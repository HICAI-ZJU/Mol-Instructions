Here is the text version of the Q&A

```
> Tell me about alpacas.
Alpacas are small, domesticated animals related to camels and llamas. They live in herds on mountainous terrain throughout South America, Central Asia, and parts of the United States. Alpaca fiber is extremely soft and silky due to its fine micro-vibrations that reflect light differently than other animal fibers such as wool or cashmere. It has become increasingly popular in recent years for knitting and weaving projects because it's hypoallergenic, sustainable, and incredibly warm. Alpacas are also known to be very gentle creatures that can even live peacefully with other animals such as sheep or goats.
> Tell me about the president of Mexico in 2019.
In 2019, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador was elected President of Mexico after winning a landslide victory with nearly two-thirds of the vote. He is known for his anti-corruption stance and has been credited with restoring public trust in government institutions since taking office last year.
