        "input": "Tomudex (ZD1694) is a specific antifolate-based thymidylate synthase inhibitor active in a variety of solid tumor malignancies. Studies were carried out in vitro to evaluate downstream molecular alterations induced as a consequence of the potent and sustained inhibition of thymidylate synthase by Tomudex. Twenty-four hours following the initial 2-h treatment with Tomudex, human A253 head and neck squamous carcinoma cells, not expressing p53 and p21(WAF1), were accumulated with DNA content characteristic of early S phase of the cell cycle with a concomitant reduction of cells in G1 and G2/M phases. The changes in cyclin and cdk protein expression and their kinase activities were examined in control and drug-treated A253 cells. Tomudex treatment resulted in the decrease in p27(kip1) expression, with an increase in cyclin E and cdk2 protein expression and kinase activities 24 h after a 2-h exposure. Although cyclin A protein expression was markedly increased, cyclin A kinase activity was only slightly increased. Cyclin D1, cyclin B, cdk4, and cdc2 protein expression and kinase activities remain constant. Lack of activation of cyclin A- and B-cdc2 was associated with a reduced proportion of cells in G2/M phases. Increased cyclin E-cdk2 protein expression was accompanied by the inhibition of DNA synthesis, with a decrease in E2F-1 expression. These results propose that cyclin E-cdk2 kinase can negatively regulate DNA replication. The studies with dThyd rescue from cyclin E-cdk2 protein overexpression and growth inhibition by Tomudex indicate that increased cyclin E-cdk2 protein expression is associated with effective inhibition of thymidylate synthase and resultant dNTP pool imbalance. Provision of dThyd more than 24 h after exposure to Tomudex allowed cells to replicate DNA for a single cycle back to G1, but did not prevent the profound growth-inhibitory effect manifested in the following 5 days. Tomudex treatment resulted in a time-dependent induction of the megabase DNA fragments, followed by secondary 50- to 300-kb DNA fragmentation. The 50- to 300-kb DNA fragmentation may be derived from the inhibition of DNA synthesis associated with cyclin E-cdk2 activation. These results suggest that the megabase DNA fragmentation is induced as a consequence of inhibition of thymidylate synthase by Tomudex and kilobase DNA fragmentation may correlate with the reduction of p27(kip1) expression and the increase in cyclin E and cdk2 kinase activities. Activation of cyclin E and cdk2 kinases allows cells to transit from G1 to S phase accompanied by the inhibition of DNA synthesis. The changes in cell cycle regulatory proteins associated with growth inhibition and DNA damage by Tomudex are not p53 dependent.",

There has been no great success with dietary means and life style modification for permanent weight loss. Various surgical treatment methods for obesity are now available. They are aimed at limiting oral energy intake with or without causing dumping or inducing selective maldigestion and malabsorption. Based on current literature, up to 75% of excess weight is lost by surgical treatment with concomitant disappearance of hyperlipidaemias, type 2 diabetes, hypertension or sleep apnoea. The main indication for operative treatment is morbid obesity (body mass index greater than 40 kg/m2) or severe obesity (body mass index > 35 kg/m2) with comorbidities of obesity. Orlistat is a new inhibitor of pancreatic lipase enzyme. At doses of 120 mg three times per day with meals it results in a 30% reduction in dietary fat absorption, which equals approximately 200 kcal daily energy deficit. In the long term, orlistat has been shown to be more effective than placebo in reducing body weight and serum total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Orlistat has a lowering effect on serum cholesterol independent of weight loss. Along with weight loss, orlistat also favourably affects blood pressure and glucose and insulin levels in obese individuals and in obese type 2 diabetic patients.",

        "input": "Mechanisms leading to down-regulation of activated microglia and astrocytes are poorly understood, in spite of the potentially detrimental role of activated glia in neurodegeneration. Prostaglandins, produced both by neurons and glia, may serve as mediators of glial and neuronal functions. We examined the influence of cyclopentenone prostaglandins and their precursors on activated glia. As models of glial activation, production of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) was studied in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated rat microglia, a murine microglial cell line BV-2, and IL-1beta-stimulated rat astrocytes. Cyclopentenone prostaglandins were potent inhibitors of iNOS induction and were more effective than their precursors, prostaglandins E2 and D2. 15-Deoxy-Delta12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) was the most potent prostaglandin among those tested. In activated microglia, 15d-PGJ2 suppressed iNOS promoter activity, iNOS mRNA, and protein levels. The action of 15d-PGJ2 does not appear to involve its nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) because troglitazone, a specific ligand of PPARgamma, was unable to inhibit iNOS induction, and neither troglitazone nor 15d-PGJ2 could stimulate the activity of a PPAR-dependent promoter in the absence of cotransfected PPARgamma. 15d-PGJ2 did not block nuclear translocation or DNA-binding activity of the transcription factor NFkappaB, but it did inhibit the activity of an NFkappaB reporter construct, suggesting that the mechanism of suppression of microglial iNOS by 15d-PGJ2 may involve interference with NFkappaB transcriptional activity in the nucleus. Thus, our data suggest the existence of a novel pathway mediated by cyclopentenone prostaglandins, which may represent part of a feedback mechanism leading to the cessation of inflammatory glial responses in the brain.",

Pretreatment of the splenocytes with both BPB and AACOCF3 suppressed phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate plus ionomycin-induced IL-2 secretion in a concentration-dependent manner.

Likewise, IL-2 steady-state mRNA expression was inhibited by both PLA2 inhibitors in a concentration-dependent fashion with > 90% inhibition at 1 microM BPB and 20 microM AACOCF3. Taken together, these data demonstrated that PLA2 inhibitors BPB and AACOCF3 are robust inhibitors of IL-2 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels in murine splenocytes.

Sumatriptan's effects might be mediated by 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D or 5-HT1F receptors. To establish the relative importance of these subtypes, we compared the effects of sumatriptan with those of a selective 5-HT1F receptor agonist (LY 344864) on c-fos protein expression in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis. c-fos expression was induced in urethane-anaesthetized rats by intracisternal capsaicin administration. Sumatriptan and LY 344864 decreased the number of capsaicin-induced c-fos-like immunoreactive cells within trigeminal nucleus caudalis (ID50 = 0.04 and 0.6 mg kg(-1)). The effect of sumatriptan, but not of LY 344864, was prevented by pretreatment with the antagonist SDZ 21-009, which displays high affinity for rat 5-HT1B receptors. LY 344864 appears to attenuate c-fos-like immunoreactivity via 5-HT1F receptors, while sumatriptan acts via 5-HT1B receptors.

The effect of BB-94 and captopril on the survival of the 3LL-tumor-bearing mice was also examined. Here we report that captopril treatment resulted in decreased transcription and protein levels of gelatinase A by 3LL cells. Both BB-94 and captopril also prevented substrate degradation by gelatinase A and B released in conditioned medium by cultured cells. Treatment of tumor-bearing animals with BB-94 (i.p.) or captopril (in drinking water) resulted in significant inhibition of the mean tumor volume (25 and 33% respectively) and of the mean lung metastasis number (26 and 29% respectively). When both agents were given, they acted in synergy, resulting in 51 and 80% inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis. The survival time of the mice treated with both BB-94 and captopril was also significantly longer compared with the groups treated with each agent alone or with the vehicle. Our data support the hypothesis of an essential role of metalloproteinase(s) in the metastatic process. Moreover, blockade of invasion, angiogenesis and other processes mediated by metalloproteinases may underlie the anti-tumor and anti-metastatic effect of BB-94 and captopril and their combination.

        "input": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the extent of human cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) inhibition by meloxicam, which has been reported to preferentially inhibit cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). The effects of meloxicam were compared with those of diclofenac, a nonselective COX inhibitor. METHODS: COX-1 inhibition was determined by measuring thromboxane B2 (TXB2)-generation from clotting whole blood ex vivo after single oral doses of 7.5 and 15 mg meloxicam and 75 mg diclofenac and at steady state (15 mg meloxicam daily and 150 mg diclofenac daily). The effect was expressed as percentage inhibition of serum TXB2 generation and was directly related to the serum drug concentration with use of a standard sigmoidal E(max) model. RESULTS: In terms of inhibition of TXB2 generation, diclofenac was about 1 order of magnitude more potent than meloxicam, indicated by a diclofenac EC50 (concentration of drug required to cause 50% of maximum effect) that was about 10 times lower than that of meloxicam (EC50 diclofenac single doses: 37.50+/-29.64; EC50 meloxicam single doses: 677.50+/-189.08). However, serum concentrations of meloxicam after administration of 15 mg were approximately 10-fold higher than those of diclofenac. Therefore there was no statistically significant difference in the area under the effect time curve (P = .115) and the mean effect (P = .424) between meloxicam and diclofenac. The EC50 of both drugs was significantly higher at steady state (diclofenac steady state: 87.07+/-55.24 ng/mL; meloxicam steady state: 1850.12+/-829.93 ng/mL) than after a single dose (P < .001). CONCLUSION: These data show that meloxicam inhibits TXB2 generation at clinically relevant doses, although less potently than diclofenac. Thus our data suggest that the COX-2 preference of meloxicam observed in vitro may not result in clinical advantages when the higher dose of 15 mg is needed. Because of the increase in EC50 at steady state, COX-1 is relatively spared when the lower dose of 7.5 mg is administered.",

No difference existed in plasma angiotensin II levels between EDN and controls. The rats were given typical rat pellets or pellets treated with 10 mg/kg per day cilazapril for 4 weeks.

The agonist potency order in rat SMA was: A61603 >> SKF89748-A > cirazoline > noradrenaline > ST-587 > methoxamine. Prazosin antagonized all agonists with a low potency (pA2: 8.29-8.80) indicating the involvement of alpha 1L-rather than alpha 1A-adrenoceptors. 3. The putative alpha 1L-adrenoceptor antagonist JTH-601, but not the alpha 1B-adrenoceptor antagonist chloroethylclonidine (10 microM) antagonized noradrenaline-induced contractions of SMA. The potency of the selective alpha 1D-adrenoceptor antagonist BMY 7378 against noradrenaline (pA2 = 6.16 +/- 0.13) and of the selective alpha 1A-adrenoceptor antagonist RS-17053 against noradrenaline (pKB = 8.35 +/- 0.10) and against the selective alpha 1A-adrenoceptor agonist A-61603 (pKB = 8.40 +/- 0.09) were too low to account for alpha 1D- and alpha 1A-adrenoceptor involvement. 4. The potency of RS-17053 (pKB/pA2's = 7.72-8.46) was not affected by lowering temperature, changing experimental protocol or inducing myogenic tone via KCl or U46619. 5. Selective protection of a putative alpha 1A-adrenoceptor population against the irreversible action of phenoxybenzamine also failed to increase the potency of RS-17053 (pA2 = 8.25 +/- 0.06 against A61603). 6. Combined concentration-ratio analysis demonstrated that tamsulosin, which does not discriminate between alpha 1A- and alpha 1L-adrenoceptors, and RS-17053 competed for binding at the same site in the SMA. 7. In summary, data obtained in our experiments in rat SMA indicate that the alpha 1-adrenoceptor mediating noradrenaline-induced contraction displays a distinct alpha 1L-adrenoceptor pharmacology.

The mice received pyridostigmine (0.06 mg/kg body weight), physostigmine (0.09 mg/kg body weight), the physostigmine derivative eptastigmine (0.90 mg/kg body weight) or phosphotriesterase (104 U/g, 10.7 microg/g body weight) 10 min prior to the i.g. administration of sarin. Physostigmine was also administered with phosphotriesterase. Phosphotriesterase was the most effective antidote in sarin intoxication. The LD50 value for sarin increased 3.4-fold in mice receiving phosphotriesterase. Physostigmine was the most effective carbamate in sarin exposure. The protective ratios of physostigmine and pyridostigmine were 1.5- and 1.2-1.3-fold, respectively. Eptastigmine did not give any protection against sarin toxicity. Both the phosphotriesterase and physostigmine treatments protected the brain AChE activities measured 24 h after sarin exposure. In phosphotriesterase and physostigmine-treated mice, a 4- and 2-fold higher sarin dose, respectively, was needed to cause a 50% inhibition of brain AChE activity. Moreover, the combination of phosphotriesterase-physostigmine increased the LD50 value for sarin 4.3-fold. The animals pretreated with phosphotriesterase-ephysostigmine tolerated four times the lethal dose in control animals, furthermore their survival time was 2-3 h in comparison to 20 min in controls. In conclusion, phosphotriesterase and physostigmine were the most effective treatments against sarin intoxication. However, eptastigmine did not provide any protection against sarin toxicity.",

        "input": "Torasemide is a loop diuretic that is effective at low once-daily doses in the treatment of arterial hypertension. Because its antihypertensive mechanism of action may not be based entirely on the elimination of salt and water from the body, a vasodilator effect of this drug can be considered. In the present study, the ability of different concentrations of torasemide to modify angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced vascular responses was examined, with the use of an organ bath system, in endothelium-denuded aortic rings from spontaneously hypertensive rats. Ang II-induced increases of intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) were also examined by image analysis in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) from spontaneously hypertensive rats. A dose-response curve to Ang II was plotted for cumulative concentrations (from 10(-9) to 10(-6) mol/L) in endothelium-denuded aortic rings (pD(2)=7.5+/-0.3). Isometric contraction induced by a submaximal concentration of Ang II (10(-7) mol/L) was reduced in a dose-dependent way by torasemide (IC(50)=0.5+/-0.04 micromol/L). Incubation of VSMCs with different concentrations of Ang II (from 10(-10) to 10(-6) mol/L) resulted in a dose-dependent rise of [Ca(2+)](i) (pD(2)=7.5+/-0.3). The stimulatory effect of [Ca(2+)](i) induced by a submaximal concentration of Ang II (10(-7) mol/L) was blocked by torasemide (IC(50)=0.5+/-0.3 nmol/L). Our findings suggest that torasemide blocks the vasoconstrictor action of Ang II in vitro. This action can be related to the ability of torasemide to block the increase of [Ca(2+)](i) induced by Ang II in VSMCs. It is proposed that these actions might be involved in the antihypertensive effect of torasemide observed in vivo.",

        "input": "Kinetic studies of tetrameric recombinant human tyrosine hydroxylase isoform 1 (hTH1) have revealed properties so far not reported for this enzyme. Firstly, with the natural cofactor (6R)-Lerythro-5,6,7, 8-tetrahydrobiopterin (H4biopterin) a time-dependent change (burst) in enzyme activity was observed, with a half-time of about 20 s for the kinetic transient. Secondly, nonhyperbolic saturation behaviour was found for H4biopterin with a pronounced negative cooperativity (0.39 < h < 0.58; [S]0.5 = 24 +/- 4 microM). On phosphorylation of Ser40 by protein kinase A, the affinity for H4biopterin increased ([S]0.5 = 11 +/- 2 microM) and the negative cooperativity was amplified (h = 0.27 +/- 0.03). The dimeric C-terminal deletion mutant (Delta473-528) of hTH1 also showed negative cooperativity of H4biopterin binding (h = 0.4). Cooperativity was not observed with the cofactor analogues 6-methyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin (h = 0.9 +/- 0.1; Km = 62.7 +/- 5.7 microM) and 3-methyl-5,6,7, 8-tetrahydropterin (H43-methyl-pterin)(h = 1.0 +/- 0.1; Km = 687 +/- 50 microM). In the presence of 1 mM H43-methyl-pterin, used as a competitive cofactor analogue to BH4, hyperbolic saturation curves were also found for H4biopterin (h = 1.0), thus confirming the genuine nature of the kinetic negative cooperativity. This cooperativity was confirmed by real-time biospecific interaction analysis by surface plasmon resonance detection. The equilibrium binding of H4biopterin to the immobilized iron-free apoenzyme results in a saturable positive resonance unit (DeltaRU) response with negative cooperativity (h = 0.52-0.56). Infrared spectroscopic studies revealed a reduced thermal stability both of the apo-and the holo-hTH1 on binding of H4biopterin and Lerythro-dihydrobiopterin (H2biopterin). Moreover, the ligand-bound forms of the enzyme also showed a decreased resistance to limited tryptic proteolysis. These findings indicate that the binding of H4biopterin at the active site induces a destabilizing conformational change in the enzyme which could be related to the observed negative cooperativity. Thus, our studies provide new insight into the regulation of TH by the concentration of H4biopterin which may have significant implications for the physiological regulation of catecholamine biosynthesis in neuroendocrine cells.",

There was a profound accumulation defect of all nucleoside analogues in the resistant variants but no significant defect in nucleoside transport in any of the variants. 5' nucleotidase activity was strongly increased and deoxycytidine kinase activity was moderately reduced in all of the resistant variants, resulting in reduced accumulation of triphosphate analogues. In addition a deletion in one of the alleles of the deoxycytidine kinase was detected in the fludarabine-resistant line. Ribonucleotide reductase activity was found to be strongly increased in the gemcitabine-selected line and purine nucleoside phosphorylase was increased in the 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine-selected line. Free nucleotide pools were increased in the 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine-selected line. There was no expression of the mdr1 gene by the resistant lines.

The pressure-natriuresis and -diuresis relationships in response to chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and AT1 receptor blockade were evaluated. Renal renin-angiotensin and nitric oxide (NO) system gene expression was also investigated. Six-week-old dTGR were treated for 3 wk with submaximal doses of cilazapril (10 mg/kg, orally) or losartan (10 mg/kg, orally) or with the drug combination. In untreated dTGR, pressure-natriuresis relationships were maximally shifted rightward by approximately 70 to 80 mmHg, and both renal blood flow (RBF) and GFR were markedly decreased. Submaximal cilazapril and losartan dosages both decreased systolic BP by 30 mmHg and shifted the pressure-natriuresis curves leftward by 25 to 30 mmHg. Cilazapril increased RBF and GFR to values observed in normotensive control animals but did not significantly affect fractional sodium excretion (FENa) or fractional water excretion (FEH2O) curves. In contrast, losartan had no significant effect on RBF or GFR but shifted the FENa and FEH2O curves leftward. The cilazapril and losartan combination completely normalized BP and shifted the pressure-natriuresis curves leftward more than did either drug alone. When cilazapril and losartan were administered at higher doses (30 mg/kg, orally), the two drugs equally shifted the pressure-natriuresis curves leftward, by 50 mmHg. Both drugs increased RBF and GFR; however, only losartan shifted FENa and FEH2O curves leftward. Human and rat renin and angiotensinogen genes were downregulated in dTGR and were increased by losartan and cilazapril treatments, whereas no changes in the expression of rat ACE and AT1A receptor genes were observed. Endothelial NO synthase expression was increased by cilazapril but not by losartan. Neither inducible NO synthase nor neural NO synthase gene expression was affected by drug treatments. Therefore, submaximal ACE inhibition enhanced sodium excretion mainly by increasing RBF and GFR, whereas submaximal AT1 receptor blockade decreased tubular sodium and water reabsorption. The combination of the two drugs produced an additive effect. The ACE inhibitor effects may involve increased endothelial NO synthase expression, perhaps related to the inhibition of bradykinin degradation.",

Here we demonstrate the acute neurochemical effects of venlafaxine on extracellular concentrations of 5-HT and noradrenaline (NA) from the rat frontal cortex using in vivo microdialysis. Administration of venlafaxine (3-50 mg/kg s.c.) resulted in a significant dose-dependent increase in extracellular NA, but produced no significant increase in 5-HT concentrations. Combination treatment with the selective 5-HT1A antagonist WAY100635 produced a dose-dependent augmentation of venlafaxine-induced (3-30 mg/kg s.c) extracellular 5-HT concentrations, but had no further effect on NA above that produced by venlafaxine alone. WAY100635, at doses as low as 0.03 mg/kg s.c., maintained this potentiation effect. The beta-adrenergic/5-HT1A receptor antagonist (+/-)pindolol and the selective 5-HT1B/D antagonist GR127935 produced no significant augmentation of venlafaxine-induced changes in either 5-HT or NA.

The inhibitory effect of endothelin-1 on the contraction induced by 5-HT is abolished by deendothelialization, by the endothelin ET(B) receptor antagonist RES 701-1, by indomethacin, or by glibenclamide. In mesenteric arteries, endothelin-1 potentiates the contractile effects of 5-HT, U46619, and vasopressin.

U46619 potentiates the 5-HT-effect in mesenteric arteries. Thus, though the contractile endothelin ET(A) receptors were not blocked, threshold concentrations of endothelin-1 inhibited contractile effects in the rat basilar artery via activation of endothelial ET(B) receptors. Prostaglandins and ATP-sensitive K+ channels are involved in this inhibitory action. In contrast, endothelin-1 potentiates contractile actions in mesenteric arteries via the release of endogeneous thromboxane A2 from non-endothelial cells.

        "input": "BACKGROUND: In essential hypertension an elevated renal vascular resistance (RVR) may be a marker of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system-mediated impairment of renal sodium excretion. This hypothesis was tested by investigating whether, in subjects with essential hypertension, the natriuretic response to specific renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade by renin-inhibitor remikiren could be predicted from pretreatment renal vascular tone. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Renal hemodynamics, and the effects of single (n = 17) and multiple doses (n = 8, 8 days) of remikiren (600 mg day-1) on sodium excretion were studied under conditions of carefully controlled sodium balance. RESULTS: Pretreatment renal vascular tone showed considerable individual differences: filtration fraction (FF) ranged from 21.2 to 30.3% and RVR from 18.8 to 33.5 10-2 mmHg min mL-1 in the single dose study, and FF from 20.8 to 24.9% and RVR from 14.8 to 28.8 10-2 mmHg min mL-1 in the multiple dose study. Remikiren induced a fall in blood pressure, FF and RVR, with considerable interindividual variability in natriuretic response. During single dose, cumulative sodium loss was 5.1 mmol per 5 h (-8.8 to +24.6), whereas after 8 days treatment cumulative sodium loss was 72 +/- 30 mmol (-46 to +187). The natriuretic response to remikiren during single as well as multiple dose significantly correlated with pretreatment renal vascular tone (estimated from FF and RVR) but not with remikiren-induced changes in renal hemodynamics or in hormonal parameters. Cumulative sodium loss was largest in patients with a higher pretreatment FF and RVR (r = 0.74, P < 0.001 and r = 0.52, P < 0.05, respectively, single dose; and r = 0.75, P < 0.05 and r = 0.73, P < 0.05, respectively, multiple dose). CONCLUSION: These data support the hypothesis that in essential hypertension an elevated renal vascular tone is a marker of RAAS-mediated impairment of sodium excretion.",

The tertiary amine appears to make a non-conventional hydrogen bond, via its N-methyl group, to Asp-72, near the top of the gorge. The hydroxyl group of the inhibitor makes a strong hydrogen bond (2.7 A) with Glu-199.

Flecainide (1-300 mM) caused tonic and use-dependent block (UDB) of I(Na) in a concentration-dependent manner.

The IC(50) value of peak and late I(Na) for WT was 127 +/- 6 and 44 +/- 2 microM (n = 20) and for DeltaKPQ was 80 +/- 9 and 19 +/- 2 microM (n = 31) respectively.

Recovery from block was slower for DeltaKPQ than for WT. We conclude that DeltaKPQ interacts differently with flecainide than with WT, leading to increased block and slowed recovery, especially for late I(Na).

        "input": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells have constitutively high expression of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) and cyclooxygenase (COX) 2. These NSCLC cells also have increased prostaglandin expression (PGE2). Many lung cancers also express 12-lipoxygenase RNA and 12-lipoxygenase protein and biosynthesize 12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, which correlates with their metastatic potential. Several studies have demonstrated that COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitors could inhibit the in vitro growth of human lung cancer cell lines. In this report, we evaluated the growth-inhibitory effects of sulindac sulfide, a COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitor; exisulind (sulindac sulfone), a novel proapoptotic agent that does not inhibit COX enzymes; and nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), a lipoxygenase inhibitor on human lung cancer cell lines. We compared these effects with those of 13-cis-retinoic acid, a chemoprevention agent, and with the cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents paclitaxel and cisplatin, alone or in combination. Our goal was to develop new chemoprevention and treatment strategies. Each of the six agents tested inhibited the in vitro growth of three NSCLC and three SCLC cell lines at the highest concentration. Paclitaxel was the most potent agent (IC50 = 0.003-0.150 microM); sulindac sulfide, NDGA, and 13-cis-retinoic acid had intermediate potency (IC50 = 4-80 microM), and cisplatin and exisulind were the least potent (IC50 = 150-500 microM). Combination studies showed synergistic interactions for sulindac sulfide, exisulind, and NDGA with paclitaxel, cisplatin, and 13-cis-retinoic acid, regardless of drug-resistance phenotype. At high concentrations, the combination of 13-cis-retinoic acid and each of the five other drugs resulted in a strong synergistic effect. These studies provide a rationale for chemoprevention (exisulind +/- retinoic acid +/- NDGA) and therapeutic (exisulind +/- paclitaxel +/- cisplatin) studies in patients at risk for, or with, lung cancer.",

J. Neurophysiol., 81 (1999) 1506-1512). We now show that mutation of the 769R/ G desensitization site (Lomeli, H.M.J., Melcher, T., Hoger, T., Geiger, J.R., Kuner, T., Monyer, H., Higuchi, M.B.A. and Seeburg, P.H, Control of kinetic properties of AMPA receptor channels by nuclear RNA editing. Science, 9(266) (1994) 1709-1713) greatly attenuates the lithium-induced potentiation of GluR3. Additionally, experiments with the non-desensitizing site-directed mutant GluR3(L507Y) (Stern-Bach, Y., Russo, S., Neuman, M. and Rosenmund, C., A point mutation in the glutamate binding site blocks desensitization of AMPA receptors. Neuron, 21 (1998) 907-918) further confirms that lithium enhances GluR3 responses by reducing desensitization, since lithium's effects are reversed in this mutant. Lithium's effects on GluR3 desensitization are distinct from the effects of aniracetam on desensitization.

Prostaglandin E1, E2, STA2 (a stable analogue of thromboxane A2), 17-phenyl-trinor-PGE2 (an EP1-selective agonist) and sulprostone (an EP3-selective agonist) inhibited the HVA Ca2+ current (HVA ICa) dose-dependently, and the rank order of potency to inhibit HVA Ca2+ channels was sulprostone>PGE2, PGE1>STA2>>17-phenyl-trinor-PGE2. SC-51089 (10(-5) M), a selective EP1-receptor antagonist, showed no effect on the PGE1- or PGE2-induced inhibition of the HVA ICa, thereby indicating that PGE1- and PGE2-induced inhibition of the HVA Ca2+ channels is possibly mediated by the EP3 receptor. The PGE1-sensitive component of the current was markedly reduced in the presence of omega-conotoxin-GVIA (3x10(-6) M), but not with nifedipine (3x10(-6) M). PGE1 and PGE2 also inhibited the remaining ICa in a saturating concentration of nifedipine, omega-conotoxin-GVIA and omega-conotoxin-MVIIC, suggesting that R-type Ca2+ channels are involved. The inhibitory effect of PGE1 or sulprostone was prevented by pretreatment with pertussis toxin [islet activating protein (IAP)] or phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), and the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor chelerythrine blocked the action of PMA.

METHODS: Expression of PR mRNA and PR protein were determined by Northern blot and HAP of single-dose saturated analysis in myometrium and leiomyomata (center and marginal area) from 27 untreated and 6 mifepristone pretreated women with leiomyomata. RESULTS: PR mRNA abundance and PR protein levels in both myomatous center and marginal area were significantly greater than those in corporal myometrium (P < 0.01) in both follicular and luteal phases, but similar between myomatous center and marginal area (P > 0.05). 6 cases pretreated with mifepristone 25 mg/day for 3 months were operated, all but one patient displayed a decrease in leiomyomata volume. PR mRNA abundance in both myometruim and leiomyomata (center and marginal area) was significantly decreased in 4 patients continuing mifepristone treatment before the operation but not in the other 2 patients stopping RU486 1 month before operation. PR protein levels in these tissues showed significant decrease in all 6 cases. CONCLUSION: There are overexpression of PRmRNA and PR protein in leiomyomata. One of the mechanism of mifepristone action on decreasing leiomyomata volume may be related to suppression on expression of PR gene.

To investigate the possibility that felbamate's favorable toxicity profile could be related to NMDA receptor subtype selectivity, we examined the specificity of felbamate block of recombinant NMDA receptors composed of the NR1a subunit and various NR2 subunits. Felbamate produced a rapid, concentration-dependent block of currents evoked by 50 microM NMDA and 10 microM glycine in human embryonic kidney 293 cells expressing the rat NR1a subunit, and either the NR2A, NR2B or NR2C subunits; the IC50 values for block were 2.6, 0.52 and 2.4 mM, respectively (holding potential, - 60 mV). The Hill coefficient values were < 1 and, in kinetic analyses, onset and recovery from block were well fit by double exponential functions, indicating binding to more than one blocking site on the NMDA receptor channel complex. The higher affinity of felbamate block of NMDA receptors containing the NR2B subunit could be accounted for by more rapid association and slower dissociation from these sites. We conclude that felbamate exhibits modest selectivity for NMDA receptors composed of NR1a/NR2B subunits. This selectivity could, in part, account for the more favorable clinical profile of felbamate in comparison with NMDA receptor antagonists that do not show subunit selectivity.",

METHODS: Seven hundred seventy-five patients with osteoarthritis were randomized to receive rofecoxib at a dosage of 25 mg or 50 mg once daily, ibuprofen 800 mg 3 times daily, or placebo. Gastroduodenal ulceration was assessed by endoscopy at 6, 12, and (for active treatment) 24 weeks. The primary and secondary end points were the incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers at 12 and 24 weeks, respectively. RESULTS: Ulcers were significantly less common (P < 0.001) following treatment with rofecoxib (25 mg or 50 mg) than with ibuprofen after 12 weeks (5.3% and 8.8% versus 29.2%, respectively) or 24 weeks (9.9% and 12.4% versus 46.8%, respectively). In the combined analysis, the 12-week ulcer incidence with 25 mg rofecoxib (4.7%) and with placebo (7.3%) satisfied prespecified criteria for equivalence.

Because of the putative supportive role in photoreceptor maintenance, it is likely that constituent molecules play key roles in photoreceptor function and may be targets for inherited retinal disease. In this study we identify and characterize SPACRCAN, a novel chondroitin proteoglycan in this matrix. SPACRCAN was cloned from a human retinal cDNA library and the gene localized to chromosome 3q11.2. Analysis of SPACRCAN mRNA and protein revealed that SPACRCAN is expressed exclusively by photoreceptors and pinealocytes. SPACRCAN synthesized by photoreceptors is localized to the interphotoreceptor matrix where it surrounds both rods and cones. The functional protein contains 1160 amino acids with a large central mucin domain, three consensus sites for glycosaminoglycan attachment, two epidermal growth factor-like repeats, a putative hyaluronan-binding motif, and a potential transmembrane domain near the C-terminal. Lectin and Western blotting indicate an M(r) around 400,000 before and 230,000 after chondroitinase ABC digestion. Removal of N- and O-linked oligosaccharides reduces the M(r) to approximately 160,000, suggesting that approximately 60% of the mass of SPACRCAN is carbohydrate. Finally, we demonstrate that SPACRCAN binds hyaluronan and propose that associations between SPACRCAN and hyaluronan may be involved in organization of the insoluble interphotoreceptor matrix, particularly as SPACRCAN is the major proteoglycan present in this matrix.",

Recent studies suggest that excessive accumulation of polyamines favors either malignant transformation or apoptosis, depending on the cell type and the stimulus. This study examines the involvement of polyamines in the induction of apoptosis by the DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor, camptothecin. In IEC-6 cells, camptothecin induced apoptosis within 6 h, accompanied by detachment of cells. Detached cells showed DNA laddering and caspase 3 induction, characteristic features of apoptosis. Depletion of putrescine, spermidine, and spermine by DL-alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), a specific inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) that is the first rate-limiting enzyme for polyamine biosynthesis, decreased the apoptotic index. Delayed apoptosis was accompanied by a decrease in caspase 3 activity in polyamine-depleted cells. Addition of putrescine restored the induction of apoptosis as indicated by an increase in the number of detached cells and caspase 3 activity. Polyamine depletion did not change the level of caspase 3 protein. Inhibition of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase by a specific inhibitor [diethylglyoxal bis-(guanylhydrazone); DEGBG] led to depletion of spermidine and spermine with a significant accumulation of putrescine and induction of ODC. The DEGBG-treated cells showed an increase in apoptosis, suggesting the importance of putrescine in the apoptotic process. Addition of putrescine to DFMO-treated cell extracts did not increase caspase 3 activity. The above results indicate that polyamine depletion delays the onset of apoptosis in IEC-6 cells and confers protection against DNA damaging agents, suggesting that polyamines might be involved in the caspase activating signal cascade.",

In addition, by comparing the combined administration of (+/-)pindolol with either WAY100635, GR127935 or isamoltane, we have determined that (+/-)pindolol produces much of its acute potentiation of fluoxetine-induced increases in extracellular 5-HT via its action at the 5-HT(1B/D) receptor in addition to any activity it has at the presynaptic 5-HT(1A) receptor.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Ogilvie's syndrome, or acute colonic pseudo-obstruction, is a common and relatively dangerous condition. If left untreated, it may cause ischemic necrosis and colonic perforation, with a mortality rate as high as 50 percent. Neostigmine enhances excitatory parasympathetic activity by competing with acetylcholine for attachment to acetylcholinesterase at sites of cholinergic transmission and enhancing cholinergic action. We hypothesized that neostigmine would restore peristalsis in patients with acute colonic pseudo-obstruction. METHODS: Twenty-eight patients at Fletcher Allen Health Care and The Cleveland Clinic Foundation were treated for acute colonic pseudo-obstruction with neostigmine 2.5 mg IV over 3 minutes while being monitored with telemetry. Mechanical obstruction had been excluded. RESULTS: Complete clinical resolution of large bowel distention occurred in 26 of the 28 patients. Time to pass flatus varied from 30 seconds to 10 minutes after administration of neostigmine. No adverse effects or complications were noted. Of the two patients who did not resolve, one had a sigmoid cancer that required resection and one patient died from multiorgan failure. CONCLUSION: This study supports the theory that acute colonic pseudo-obstruction is the result of excessive parasympathetic suppression rather than sympathetic overactivity. We have shown that neostigmine is a safe and effective treatment for acute colonic pseudo-obstruction.",

H(4)biopterin substituted at N(5) with methyl, hydroxymethyl, formyl and acetyl groups were used. Substitution at N(5) occurs at a position critical to the redox cycle of the cofactor in phenylalanine hydroxylase/dihydropteridine reductase. We also included N(2)'-methyl H(4)biopterin, a derivative substituted at a position not directly involved in redox cycling, as a control. As compared with N(5)-methyl H(4)biopterin, N(5)-formyl H(4)biopterin bound with twice the capacity but stimulated nitric oxide synthase to a lesser extent. Depending on the substituent used, N(5)-substituted derivatives were redox-active: N(5)-methyl- and N(5)-hydroxyl methyl H(4)biopterin, but not N(5)-formyl- and N(5)-acetyl H(4)biopterin, reduced 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol. N(5)-Substituted H(4)biopterin derivatives were not oxidized to products serving as substrates for dihydropteridine reductase and,depending on the substituent, were competitive inhibitors of phenylalanine hydroxylase: N(5)-methyl- and N(5)-hydroxymethyl H(4)biopterin inhibited phenylalanine hydroxylase, whereas N(5)-formyl- and N(5)-acetyl H(4)biopterin had no effect. Our data demonstrate differences in the mechanism of stimulation of phenylalanine hydroxylase and nitric oxide synthase by H(4)biopterin.

In this study, we examined whether betaxolol and other beta-adrenoceptor antagonists interact directly with neurotoxin binding to sites 1 and 2 of the voltage-sensitive sodium channel (Na(+) channel) in rat cerebrocortical synaptosomes. Betaxolol inhibited specific [(3)H]-batrachotoxinin-A 20-alpha-benzoate ([(3)H]-BTX-B) binding to neurotoxin site 2 in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC(50) value of 9.8 microM. Comparison of all the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists tested revealed a potency order of propranolol>betaxolol approximately levobetaxolol>levobunolol approximately carteolol>/=timolol>atenolol. None of the drugs caused a significant inhibition of [(3)H]-saxitoxin binding to neurotoxin receptor site 1, even at concentrations as high as 250 microM. Saturation experiments showed that betaxolol increased the K(D) of [(3)H]-BTX-B binding but had no effect on the B(max). The association kinetics of [(3)H]-BTX-B were unaffected by betaxolol, but the drug significantly accelerated the dissociation rate of the radioligand. These findings argue for a competitive, indirect, allosteric mode of inhibition of [(3)H]-BTX-B binding by betaxolol. Betaxolol inhibited veratridine-stimulated Na(+) influx in rat cortical synaptosomes with an IC(50) value of 28. 3 microM. Carteolol, levobunolol, timolol and atenolol were significantly less effective than betaxolol at reducing veratridine-evoked Na(+) influx. The ability of betaxolol to interact with neurotoxin site 2 of the Na(+) channel and inhibit Na(+) influx may have a role in its neuroprotective action in paradigms of excitotoxicity/ischaemia and in its therapeutic effect in glaucoma.",

To investigate ways of overcoming 5-FU-resistance, we established acquired-resistant colorectal cancer cell lines against these three drugs by continuous and step-wise escalation of drugs, and analyzed the cytotoxicity and the mechanism of resistance to the drugs. When cells were incubated with the 3 drugs for 72 h, the resistance ratio to parental DLD-1 human colorectal tumor cells was 65.2 for DLD-1/5-FU, 9.7 for DLD-1/FdUrd and 448.6 for DLD-1/F3(d)Thd cells. DLD-1/5-FU cells did not show any cross-resistance against FdUrd and F(3)dThd. However, DLD-1/FdUrd cells showed 3- and 9-fold increased resistance to 5-FU and F3(d)Thd, respectively, and DLD-1/F3(d)Thd cells also showed about 90-fold resistance to FdUrd. Analysis of enzyme activities and gene expression associated with pyrimidine metabolism indicated that a significant decrease in orotate phosphoribosyltransferase activity in DLD-1/5-FU cells, a 7-fold increase of TS mRNA in DLD-1/FdUrd cells, and a 37-fold decrease in thymidine kinase activity of DLD-1/F3(d)Thd cells were the major mechanisms of drug resistance. These findings were closely associated with the cytotoxicity of 5-FU, FdUrd and F3(d)Thd against the established 5-FU-, FdUrd- or F3(d)Thd-resistant cells. When DLD-1/FdUrd cells expressing increased TS mRNA were treated with FdUrd and F3(d)Thd for only 4 h, the resistance ratios of DLD-1/FdUrd cells to parental DLD-1 cells were markedly different for FdUrd and F3(d)Thd, suggesting that the cytotoxicity with short-time exposure to F3(d)Thd is due to a mechanism other than TS inhibition, although the cytotoxicity of F3(d)Thd in the short-time is low compared to that of long-time exposure. In conclusion, F3(d)Thd, an antimetabolite that inhibits TS activity, may be effective against 5-FU and/or FdUrd-resistance in colorectal cancer cells caused by amplification of TS and/or deletion of orotate phosphoribosyltransferase.",

Here we introduce novel compounds in which an olefinic functionality is incorporated into peptide analogues as the most potent turnover-dependent inactivators of PAM. Kinetic parameters for PAM inactivation by 4-oxo-5-acetamido-6-phenyl-hex-2-enoic acid and 4-oxo-5-acetamido-6-(2-thienyl)-hex-2-enoic acid were obtained by using both the conventional dilution assay method and the more complex progress curve method. The results obtained from the progress curve method establish that these compounds exhibit the kinetic characteristics of pure competitive inactivators (i.e. no ESI complex forms during inactivation). On the basis of k(inact)/K(i) values, 4-oxo-5-acetamido-6-(2-thienyl)-hex-2-enoic acid is almost two orders of magnitude more potent than benzoylacrylate, a chemically analogous olefinic inactivator that lacks the peptide moiety. Stereochemical studies established that PAM inactivation by 4-oxo-5-acetamido-6-(2-thienyl)-hex-2-enoic acid is stereospecific with respect to the moiety at the P(2) position, which is consistent with previous results with substrates and reversible inhibitors. In contrast, 2, 4-dioxo-5-acetamido-6-phenylhexanoic acid, which is a competitive inhibitor with respect to ascorbate, exhibits a low degree of stereospecificity in binding to the ascorbate sites of both PAM and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase.",

The enzyme dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH) specifically hydrolyzes these asymmetrically methylated arginine residues to citrulline and methylamines. Previously we have proposed that regulation of asymmetric methylarginine concentration by DDAH may provide a novel mechanism for the regulation of NOS activity in vivo. Recently we reported the cloning of human DDAH and identified a novel human DDAH isoform (DDAH I and DDAH II, respectively). Here we report that the DDAH1 gene maps to chromosome 1p22 and confirm that DDAH2 maps to the MHC III region of chromosome 6p21.3. Extensive analysis of the distribution of DDAH1 and DDAH2 mRNA in 50 human tissues indicates differential expression of DDAH isoforms in brain regions, in immune cells, and during development. DDAH2 expression predominates in highly vascularized tissues that express the endothelial NOS isoform and in immune tissues that can express iNOS. Whereas DDAH2 is expressed at relatively high levels in all fetal tissues examined, DDAH1 expression varies little between fetal and adult tissues. The chromosomal localization of the DDAHs is consistent with gene duplication, and consistent with this, comparison of the gene structures indicates that the intron/exon organization is highly conserved. Phylogenetic analysis of DDAH sequences from diverse species suggests that DDAH gene duplication occurred prior to the emergence of bony fish some 400 million years ago. Overall the data suggest that DDAH2 may be the more ancient of the two genes.",

        "input": "On the basis of data obtained in rabbits, the imidazoline receptor ligand rilmenidine has been suggested to decrease blood pressure in humans by activating central alpha(2A)-adrenoceptors. A prerequisite for this hypothesis was the unproved assumption that rabbit and human alpha(2A)-adrenoceptors are equally activated by rilmenidine. Because alpha(2A)-adrenoceptors in the brain and on cardiovascular sympathetic nerve terminals are identical, the latter were used as a model for the former to confirm or disprove this assumption. Human atrial appendages and rabbit pulmonary arteries were used to determine the potencies of alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonists in inhibiting the electrically (2 Hz) evoked [(3)H]norepinephrine release and of antagonists in counteracting the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor-mediated inhibition induced by moxonidine. In the rabbit pulmonary artery, rilmenidine and oxymetazoline are potent full agonists, whereas in the human atrial appendages they are antagonists at the alpha(2)-autoreceptors, sharing this property with rauwolscine, phentolamine, and idazoxan. In contrast, prazosin is ineffective. In addition, a partial nucleotide and amino acid sequence of the rabbit alpha(2A)-adrenoceptor (a region known to substantially influence the pharmacological characteristics of the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor) revealed marked differences between the rabbit and the human alpha(2A)-adrenoceptor. The sympathetic nerves of both the human atrial appendages and rabbit pulmonary artery are endowed with alpha(2A)-autoreceptors, at which, however, both rilmenidine and oxymetazoline exhibit different properties (antagonism and agonism, respectively). The antagonistic property of rilmenidine at human alpha(2A)-adrenoceptors indicates that in contrast to the suggestion based on rabbit data, the hypotensive property of the drug in humans is not due to activation of alpha(2A)-adrenoceptors but other, presumably I(1)-imidazoline receptors, are probably involved.",

In the present study, we determined the mechanisms underlying this process. U50, 488H caused a significant down-regulation of the hkor, although etorphine did not. Neither U50,488H nor etorphine caused down-regulation of the rat kappa-opioid receptor. Thus, similar to internalization, there are agonist and species differences in down-regulation of kappa-opioid receptors. Expression of the dominant negative mutants arrestin-2(319-418) or dynamin I-K44A significantly reduced U50,488H-induced down-regulation of the hkor. Coexpression of GRK2 or GRK2 and arrestin-2 permitted etorphine to induce down-regulation of the hkor, although expression of arrestin-2 or dynamin I alone did not. Expression of the dominant negative mutants rab5A-N133I or rab7-N125I blunted U50,488H-induced down-regulation.

A combination of chloroquine and proteasome inhibitor I abolished U50,488H-induced down-regulation. These results indicate that U50,488H-induced down-regulation of the hkor involves GRK-, arrestin-2-, dynamin-, rab5-, and rab7-dependent mechanisms and receptors seem to be trafficked to lysosomes and proteasomes for degradation. Thus, U50,488H-induced internalization and down-regulation of the hkor share initial common mechanisms. To the best of our knowledge, these results represent the first report on the involvement of both rab5 and rab7 in agonist-induced down-regulation of a G protein-coupled receptor.

The BH(4) treatment was associated with a 2-fold increase in eNOS activity as well as a 70% reduction in endothelial O(2)(-) production compared with those in fructose-fed rats. The BH(4) treatment also partially improved the insulin sensitivity and blood pressure, as well as the serum triglyceride concentration, in the fructose-fed rats. Moreover, BH(4) treatment of the fructose-fed rats markedly reduced the lipid peroxide content of both aortic and cardiac tissues and inhibited the activation of 2 redox-sensitive transcription factors, nuclear factor-kappaB and activating protein-1, which were increased in fructose-fed rats.

In Helicobacter pylori, this enzyme appears to be constitutively expressed under microaerobic conditions and is not essential for its survival in vitro. In this study, the role of FRD in the colonization of H. pylori was investigated using a mouse model. The frdA gene coding for subunit A of FRD, and two control genes, copA and copP associated with the export of copper out of H. pylori, were inactivated by insertion of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase cassette into these individual genes. The isogenic mutants of H. pylori strain AH244 were obtained by natural transformation. Seventy-five ICR mice (15 mice/group) were orogastrically dosed with either the wild type H. pylori strain AH244, its isogenic mutants, or Brucella broth (negative control). Five mice from each group were killed at 2, 4 and 8 weeks post-inoculation (WPI), respectively. H. pylori colonization was not detected in mouse gastric mucosa infected with the frdA mutant at any time point in the study by both quantitative culture and PCR. In contrast, the mice inoculated with either wild type AH244, copA or copPH. pylori mutants became readily infected. These data indicate that FRD plays a crucial role in H. pylori survival in the gastric mucosa of mice.

We used the human islet cell mAbs MICA3 and MICA4 to identify the Ab epitopes of GAD65 by screening phage-displayed random peptide libraries. The identified peptide sequences could be mapped to a homology model of the pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) binding domain of GAD65. For MICA3, a surface loop containing the sequence PEVKEK and two adjacent exposed helixes were identified in the PLP binding domain as well as a region of the C terminus of GAD65 that has previously been identified as critical for MICA3 binding. To confirm that the loop containing the PEVKEK sequence contributes to the MICA3 epitope, this loop was deleted by mutagenesis. This reduced binding of MICA3 by 70%. Peptide sequences selected using MICA4 were rich in basic or hydroxyl-containing amino acids, and the surface of the GAD65 PLP-binding domain surrounding Lys358, which is known to be critical for MICA4 binding, was likewise rich in these amino acids. Also, the two phage most reactive with MICA4 encoded the motif VALxG, and the reverse of this sequence, LAV, was located in this same region. Thus, we have defined the MICA3 and MICA4 epitopes on GAD65 using the combination of phage display, molecular modeling, and mutagenesis and have provided compelling evidence for the involvement of the PEVKEK loop in the MICA3 epitope.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Serotonin 5-HT(4) receptors are located on enteric cholinergic neurones and may regulate peristalsis. 5-HT(4) receptors on primary afferent neurones have been postulated to modulate visceral sensation. While 5-HT(4) agonists are used as prokinetic agents, the physiological role of 5-HT(4) receptors in the human gut is unknown. AIMS: Our aim was to characterise the role of 5-HT(4) receptors in regulating gastrointestinal motor and sensory function in healthy subjects under baseline and stimulated conditions with a 5-HT(4) receptor antagonist. METHODS: Part A compared the effects of placebo to four doses of a 5-HT(4) receptor antagonist (SB-207266) on the cisapride mediated increase in plasma aldosterone (a 5-HT(4) mediated response) and orocaecal transit in 18 subjects. In part B, 52 healthy subjects received placebo, or 0.05, 0.5, or 5 mg of SB-207266 for 10-12 days; gastric, small bowel, and colonic transit were measured by scintigraphy on days 7-9, and fasting and postprandial colonic motor function, compliance, and sensation during distensions were assessed on day 12. RESULTS: Part A: 0.5, 5, and 20 mg doses of SB-207266 had significant and quantitatively similar effects, antagonising the cisapride mediated increase in plasma aldosterone and acceleration of orocaecal transit. Part B: SB-207266 tended to delay colonic transit (geometric centre of isotope at 24 (p=0.06) and 48 hours (p=0.08)), but did not have dose related effects on transit, fasting or postprandial colonic motor activity, compliance, or sensation. CONCLUSION: 5-HT(4) receptors are involved in the regulation of cisapride stimulated orocaecal transit; SB 207266 tends to modulate colonic transit but not sensory functions or compliance in healthy human subjects.",

        "input": "Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-binding protein (IGFBP)-related proteins (IGFBP-rPs) are newly described cysteine-rich proteins that share significant aminoterminal structural similarity with the conventional IGFBPs and are involved in a diversity of biological functions, including growth regulation. IGFBP-rP1 (MAC25/Angiomodulin/prostacyclin-stimulating factor) is a potential tumor-suppressor gene that is differentially expressed in meningiomas, mammary and prostatic cancers, compared with their malignant counterparts. We have previously shown that IGFBP-rP1 is preferentially produced by primary cultures of human prostate epithelial cells (HPECs) and by poorly tumorigenic P69SV40T cells, compared with the cancerous prostatic LNCaP, DU145, PC-3, and M12 cells. We now show that IGFBP-rP1 increases during senescence of HPEC. IGFBP-rP2 (also known as connective tissue growth factor), a downstream effector of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and modulator of growth for both fibroblasts and endothelial cells, was detected in most of the normal and malignant prostatic epithelial cells tested, with a marked up-regulation of IGFBP-rP2 during senescence of HPEC. Moreover, IGFBP-rP2 noticeably increased in response to TGF-beta1 and all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) in HPEC and PC-3 cells, and it decreased in response to IGF-I in HPEC. IGFBP-rP3 [nephroblastoma overexpressed (NOV)], the protein product of the NOV protooncogene, was not detected in HPEC but was expressed in the tumorigenic DU145 and PC-3 cells. It was also synthesized by the SV40-T antigen-transformed P69 and malignant M12 cells, where it was down-regulated by atRA. These observations suggest biological roles of IGFBP-rPs in the human prostate. IGFBP-rP1 and IGFBP-rP2 are likely to negatively regulate growth, because they seem to increase during senescence of the prostate epithelium and in response to growth inhibitors (TGF-beta1 and atRA). Although the data collected on IGFBP-rP3 in prostate are modest, its role as a growth stimulator and/or protooncogene is supported by its preferential expression in cancerous cells and its down-regulation by atRA.",

        "input": "1. Peptidergic neurones accumulate amines via an unusual uptake process, designated Transport-P. [(3)H]-prazosin binds to alpha(1) adrenoceptors on these cells and is displaceable by unlabelled prazosin in concentrations up to 10(-7) M. However, at greater concentrations of prazosin, there is a paradoxical accumulation of [(3)H]-prazosin which we have attributed to Transport-P. Uptake of prazosin via Transport-P is detectable at 10(-10) M prazosin concentration, is linear up to 10(-7) M and at greater concentrations becomes non-linear. In contrast, in noradrenergic neurones, noradrenaline uptake is linear and saturates above 10(-7) M. In noradrenergic neurones and in non-neuronal cells, there is no uptake of prazosin in concentrations up to 10(-6) M, suggesting that Transport-P is a specialised function of peptidergic neurones. 2. Using a mouse peptidergic (gonadotrophin-releasing hormone, GnRH) neuronal cell line which possesses Transport-P, we have studied the interaction of alpha(1) adrenoceptors with Transport-P. Polymerase chain reactions and DNA sequencing of the products demonstrated that only the alpha(1B) sub-type of adrenoceptors is present in GnRH cells. 3. In COS cells transfected with alpha(1b) adrenoceptor cDNA and in DDT(1) MF-2 cells which express native alpha(1B) adrenoceptors, [(3)H]-prazosin was displaced by unlabelled prazosin in a normal equilibrium process, with no prazosin paradox in concentrations up to 10(-6) M. In DDT(1) MF-2 cells, [(3)H]-prazosin was displaced likewise by a series of alpha(1) adrenergic agonists, none of which increased the binding of [(3)H]-prazosin. Hence, the prazosin paradox is not due to some function of alpha(1) adrenoceptors, such as internalization of ligand-receptor complexes. 4. In neurones which possess Transport-P, transfection with alpha(1b) adrenoceptor cDNA resulted in over-expression of alpha(1B) adrenoceptors, but the prazosin paradox was unaltered. Thus, alpha(1) adrenoceptors and Transport-P mediate distinct functions in peptidergic neurones.",

        "input": "Voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs) are multimeric complexes composed of a pore-forming alpha(1) subunit together with several accessory subunits, including alpha(2)delta, beta, and, in some cases, gamma subunits. A family of VDCCs known as the L-type channels are formed specifically from alpha(1S) (skeletal muscle), alpha(1C) (in heart and brain), alpha(1D) (mainly in brain, heart, and endocrine tissue), and alpha(1F) (retina). Neuroendocrine L-type currents have a significant role in the control of neurosecretion and can be inhibited by GTP-binding (G-) proteins. However, the subunit composition of the VDCCs underlying these G-protein-regulated neuroendocrine L-type currents is unknown. To investigate the biophysical and pharmacological properties and role of G-protein modulation of alpha(1D) calcium channels, we have examined calcium channel currents formed by the human neuronal L-type alpha(1D) subunit, co-expressed with alpha(2)delta-1 and beta(3a), stably expressed in a human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cell line, using whole cell and perforated patch-clamp techniques. The alpha(1D)-expressing cell line exhibited L-type currents with typical characteristics. The currents were high-voltage activated (peak at +20 mV in 20 mM Ba2+) and showed little inactivation in external Ba2+, while displaying rapid inactivation kinetics in external Ca2+. The L-type currents were inhibited by the 1,4 dihydropyridine (DHP) antagonists nifedipine and nicardipine and were enhanced by the DHP agonist BayK S-(-)8644. However, alpha(1D) L-type currents were not modulated by activation of a number of G-protein pathways. Activation of endogenous somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (sst2) by somatostatin-14 or activation of transiently transfected rat D2 dopamine receptors (rD2(long)) by quinpirole had no effect. Direct activation of G-proteins by the nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue, guanosine 5'-0-(3-thiotriphospate) also had no effect on the alpha(1D) currents. In contrast, in the same system, N-type currents, formed from transiently transfected alpha(1B)/alpha(2)delta-1/beta(3), showed strong G-protein-mediated inhibition. Furthermore, the I-II loop from the alpha(1D) clone, expressed as a glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion protein, did not bind Gbetagamma, unlike the alpha(1B) I-II loop fusion protein. These data show that the biophysical and pharmacological properties of recombinant human alpha(1D) L-type currents are similar to alpha(1C) currents, and these currents are also resistant to modulation by G(i/o)-linked G-protein-coupled receptors.",

The present clinical trial was performed to study the effect and safety of pranlukast in mild-to-moderate asthma. METHODOLOGY: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study was performed in eight medical centres in Korea. Mild-to-moderate asthma patients who had been treated with beta2-agonists and/or inhaled corticosteroids were studied. The patients' symptoms were evaluated by asthma diary and twice-daily peak flow monitoring. RESULTS: Of the 206 patients enrolled, 197 were eligible for analysis. The pranlukast group (n = 98) showed statistically significant improvement in asthma symptoms, including asthma attack rate, daily living score, and morning and evening asthma scores. Pranlukast significantly reduced the consumption of beta2-agonist. Compared with the placebo group, forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) were not significantly higher in the pranlukast group. Morning and evening peak expiratory flow (PEF) were significantly increased after pranlukast treatment at weeks 2 and 4 (380.8 +/- 10.1 L/min at baseline, 394.5 +/- 10.1 at week 2, 396.3 +/- 10.4 at week 4).

In the current studies, we show that two different classes (ATP-sensitive and -insensitive) of TOP2 poisons can be identified based on their differential sensitivity to the ATP-bound conformation of TOP2. First, in the presence of 1 mm ATP or the nonhydrolyzable analog adenosine 5'-(beta,gamma-imino)triphosphate, TOP2-mediated DNA cleavage induced by ATP-sensitive TOP2 poisons (e.g. doxorubicin, etoposide, mitoxantrone, and 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfon-m-anisidide) was 30-100-fold stimulated, whereas DNA cleavage induced by ATP-insensitive TOP2 poisons (e.g. amonafide, batracylin, and menadione) was only slightly (less than 3-fold) affected. In addition, ADP was shown to strongly antagonize TOP2-mediated DNA cleavage induced by ATP-sensitive but not ATP-insensitive TOP2 poisons. Second, C427A mutant human TOP2alpha, which exhibits reduced ATPase activity, was shown to exhibit cross-resistance to all ATP-sensitive but not ATP-insensitive TOP2 poisons. Third, using ciprofloxacin competition assay, TOP2-mediated DNA cleavage induced by ATP-sensitive but not ATP-insensitive poisons was shown to be antagonized by ciprofloxacin. These results suggest that ATP-bound TOP2 may be the specific target of ATP-sensitive TOP2 poisons. Using Lac repressor-operator complexes as roadblocks, we show that ATP-bound TOP2 acts as a circular clamp capable of entering DNA ends and sliding on unobstructed duplex DNA.",

        "input": "Fluorescence and stopped flow methods were used to compare clinically used heparins with regard to their ability to bind to antithrombin and to accelerate the inactivation of factor Xa. Titration of antithrombin with both low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) (enoxaparin, fragmin and ardeparin) and unfractionated heparin (UFH) produced an equivalent fluorescence increase and indicates similar affinity of all heparin preparations to antithrombin. However, relative to UFH enoxaparin, the LMWH with the smallest average molecular mass, contained only 12% material with high affinity for antithrombin. The rate of factor Xa inhibition by antithrombin increased with the concentration of the examined heparins to the same limiting value, but the concentration required for maximal acceleration depended on the preparation. According to these data the high affinity fraction of the heparin preparations increased the intrinsic fluorescence and inhibitory activity equally without additional effects by variations in chain length and chemical composition. In contrast, in the presence of Ca UFH accelerated the inhibition of factor Xa by antithrombin 10-fold more efficiently than comparable concentrations of the high affinity fractions of enoxaparin and fragmin. The bell-shaped dependence of this accelerating effect suggests simultaneous binding of both proteins to heparin. In conclusion, under physiologic conditions the anti-factor Xa activity of heparin results from a composite effect of chain length and the content of material with high affinity to antithrombin. Thus, the reduced antithrombotic activity of LMWH relative to UFH results from a smaller content of high affinity material and the absence of a stimulating effect of calcium.",

In order to determine whether the subcellular locations differed for each of the three ACSs present in liver and whether these isoforms were regulated independently, non-cross-reacting peptide antibodies were raised against ACS1, ACS4, and ACS5. ACS1 was identified in endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria-associated membrane (MAM), and cytosol, but not in mitochondria. ACS4 was present primarily in MAM, and the 76-kDa ACS5 protein was located in mitochondrial membrane. Consistent with these locations, N-ethylmaleimide, an inhibitor of ACS4, inhibited ACS activity 47% in MAM and 28% in endoplasmic reticulum. Troglitazone, a second ACS4 inhibitor, inhibited ACS activity <10% in microsomes and mitochondria and 45% in MAM. Triacsin C, a competitive inhibitor of both ACS1 and ACS4, inhibited ACS activity similarly in endoplasmic reticulum, MAM, and mitochondria, suggesting that a hitherto unidentified triacsin-sensitive ACS is present in mitochondria. ACS1, ACS4, and ACS5 were regulated independently by fasting and re-feeding. Fasting rats for 48 h resulted in a decrease in ACS4 protein, and an increase in ACS5. Re-feeding normal chow or a high sucrose diet for 24 h after a 48-h fast increased both ACS1 and ACS4 protein expression 1.5-2.0-fold, consistent with inhibition studies.

In the present study, the capacity of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors to interact with muscarinic receptors was assessed by their ability to displace both [3H]-oxotremorine-M and [3H]-quinuclinidyl benzilate binding in rat brain membranes. The [3H]-quinuclinidyl benzilate/[3H]-oxotremorine-M affinity ratios permitted predictions to be made of either the antagonist or agonist properties of the different compounds. A series of compounds, representative of the principal classes of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, displaced [3H]-oxotremorine-M binding with high-to-moderate potency (ambenonium>neostigmine=pyridostigmine=tacrine>physostigmine> edrophonium=galanthamine>desoxypeganine) whereas only ambenonium and tacrine displaced [3H]-quinuclinidyl benzilate binding. Inhibitors such as desoxypeganine, parathion and gramine demonstrated negligible inhibition of the binding of both radioligands. Scatchard plots constructed from the inhibition of [3H]-oxotremorine-M binding in the absence and presence of different inhibitors showed an unaltered Bmax and a reduced affinity constant, indicative of potential competitive or allosteric mechanisms. The capacity of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, with the exception of tacrine and ambenonium, to displace bound [3H]-oxotremorine-M in preference to [3H]quinuclinidyl benzilate predicts that the former compounds could act as potential agonists at muscarinic receptors. Moreover, the rank order for potency in inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (ambenonium>neostigmine=physostigmine =tacrine>pyridostigmine=edrophonium=galanthamine >desoxypeganine>parathion>gramine) indicated that the most effective inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase also displaced [3H]-oxotremorine-M to the greatest extent. The capacity of these inhibitors to displace [3H]-oxotremorine-M binding preclude their utilisation for the prevention of acetylcholine catabolism in rat brain membranes, the latter being required to estimate the binding of acetylcholine to [3H]-oxotremorine-M-labelled muscarinic receptors. However, fasciculin-2, a potent peptide inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (IC50 24 nM), did prevent catabolism of acetylcholine in rat brain membranes with an atypical inhibition isotherm of [3H]-oxotremorine-M binding, thus permitting an estimation of the \"global affinity\" of acetylcholine (Ki 85 nM) for [3H]-oxotremorine-M-labelled muscarinic receptors in rat brain.",

BACKGROUND: Although neurohormonal status has known prognostic significance in heart failure, the predictive power of either N-BNP or adrenomedullin in chronic ischemic LV dysfunction has not been previously reported. METHODS: Plasma N-BNP and adrenomedullin were measured in 297 patients with chronic ischemic (LV) dysfunction before randomization to carvedilol or placebo, added to established treatment with a converting enzyme inhibitor and loop diuretic (with or without digoxin). The patients' clinical outcomes, induding mortality and heart failure events, were recorded for 18 months. RESULTS: Above-median N-BNP and adrenomedullin levels conferred increased risks (all p < 0.001) of mortality (risk ratios [95% confidence intervals]: 4.67 [2-10.9] and 3.92 [1.76-8.7], respectively) and hospital admission with heart failure (4.7 [2.2-10.3] and 2.4 [1.3-4.5], respectively). Both of these predicted death or heart failure independent of age, New York Heart Association functional class, LV ejection fraction, previous myocardial infarction or previous admission with heart failure. Carvedilol reduced the risk of death or heart failure in patients with above-median levels of N-BNP or adrenomedullin, or both, to rates not significantly different from those observed in patients with levels below the median value. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with established ischemic LV dysfunction, plasma N-BNP and adrenomedullin are independent predictors of mortality and heart failure. Carvedilol reduced mortality and heart failure in patients with higher pre-treatment plasma N-BNP and adrenomedullin.",

        "input": "OBJECTIVES: In this paper we investigated the effect of indomethacin, acetazolamide and their combination in vitro and in vivo on carbonic anhydrase (CA) isozymes. METHOD: In vitro experiments followed the effect of the two substances at concentrations between 10(-8)-10(-4) M on purified human red cell CA I and II as well as on human gastric mucosa CA IV using dose-response relationships. Kinetic studies were also performed. The effects of single and combined administration of indomethacin and acetazolamide on red cell CA and on gastric acid secretion were studied in vivo. RESULTS: Indomethacin, in vitro and in vivo. induces an increase in erythorcyte CA I and CA II activity. Acetazolamide, a specific inhibitor of CA, reduces the activity of CA I and CA II from red cells. Indomethacin completely antagonizes CA activity, i.e. abolishes the inhibitory effect of acetazolamide on CA. In humans, an increase or decrease in erythrocyte CA II activity is correlated with an increase or decrease in gastric acid secretion. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that indomethacin, a known cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor, is also an activator of CA. Our data also prove that indomethacin is not only an activator of CA but also antagonizes the effect of acetazolamide, a specific inhibitor of this enzyme. In view of the role of CA in acid-base balance as well as the fact that an increase or decrease in its activity is accompanied by an increase or decrease in intra- and extracellular pH, our results suggest that: firstly, CA activation induced by indomethacin might cause changes in COX activity; secondly, PGs are synthetized as a consequence of the changes in COX activity, a hypothesis that requires further study.",

Northern analysis confirmed that the channel was localized to brain relative to other tissues including heart, liver and lung. Within the brain, erg3 was expressed in higher amounts in the frontal lobe and cerebellum relative to the temporal, parietal and occipital lobes. Transient expression of erg3 in Chinese hamster ovary cells produced outwardly directed K(+) currents that activated at approximately -50 mV and produced a large transient component at positive membrane potentials. Inward tail currents measured at -100 mV were blocked in a dose-dependent fashion by sertindole resulting in an IC(50) value of 43 nM. Significant inhibition was observed at concentrations as low as 3 nM. Block of erg3 by sertindole also displayed a positive voltage-dependence. Pimozide blocked erg3 channel currents with an IC(50) of 103 nM and significant inhibition was noted at concentrations of 10 nM and higher. We conclude that erg3 can be blocked by certain antipsychotic drugs like sertindole and pimozide.

In mammals, the principal androgens are testosterone and its 5alpha-reduced metabolite, 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Although these androgenic hormones are diverse in character, it is believed that their effects are mediated via the protein products of a single androgen receptor gene encoded on the X-chromosome. A great deal of information has now accumulated pertaining to the mechanisms by which nuclear receptors, such as the androgen receptor, modulate the activity of responsive genes. The studies have demonstrated the participation of a number of ancillary proteins in modulating activation or repression by nuclear receptors. In addition to studies focused on the mechanisms of nuclear receptor function, additional work has illuminated the mechanism by which androgens are metabolized in selected tissues. This information provides a perspective on the number of levels of complexity by which differential gene regulation by androgens may occur in different tissues and in different cell types.",

Targeting specific enzymes by small chemicals raises the question about the appropriateness of this approach. As an example, the urokinase (uPA) is recognized as an important enzyme responsible for cancer metastasis and angiogenesis. It is therefore important to ask the question if a small chemical will inhibit uPA of different species with the same or different potency. Using DNA sequence and known structure of uPA we have modeled 3D structures of uPAs for several different species. By theoretical calculations we have determined most probable structure of amiloride/uPAs complexes. Catalytic triad (B57, B102, B195) and specificity pocket (B187-B197, B212-B229) are highly conserved in all cases, and are the regions responsible for proteolytic activity and recognition of the substrate. Significant differences were observed in a different region (loop B93-B101), that we identified as binding site of amiloride to the tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Although tPA shares the same function of activating plasminogen and it is structurally similar to uPA. Amiloride is a specific inhibitor of uPA but does not inhibit tPA. Our study shows that predicted position of amiloride depends on species and in some cases was located, as expected, in the specificity pocket, but in the other cases close to the loop B93-B101. This location could weaken affinity of binding or prevent inhibition of uPA. Therefore, drug screening and elimination process based solely on animal study, without careful structural analysis, could lead to the elimination of potential drugs for humans.",

However, because it remains unclear which tumor types are the best targets for treatment with this agent, the molecular characteristics that correlate with tumor sensitivity to ZD1839 have been studied. In a panel of human breast cancer and other epithelial tumor cell lines, HER2-overexpressing tumors were particularly sensitive to ZD1839. Growth inhibition of these tumor cell lines was associated with the dephosphorylation of EGFR, HER2, and HER3, accompanied by the loss of association of HER3 with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and down-regulation of Akt activity.

However, its selectivity for the various K(ATP) channels is not known. In this study, we examined the effects of mitiglinide on various cloned K(ATP) channels (Kir6.2/SUR1, Kir6.2/SUR2A, and Kir6.2/SUR2B) reconstituted in COS-1 cells, and compared them to another meglitinide-related compound, nateglinide. Patch-clamp analysis using inside-out recording configuration showed that mitiglinide inhibits the Kir6.2/SUR1 channel currents in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 value, 100 nM) but does not significantly inhibit either Kir6.2/SUR2A or Kir6.2/SUR2B channel currents even at high doses (more than 10 microM). Nateglinide inhibits Kir6.2/SUR1 and Kir6.2/SUR2B channels at 100 nM, and inhibits Kir6.2/SUR2A channels at high concentrations (1 microM). Binding experiments on mitiglinide, nateglinide, and repaglinide to SUR1 expressed in COS-1 cells revealed that they inhibit the binding of [3H]glibenclamide to SUR1 (IC50 values: mitiglinide, 280 nM; nateglinide, 8 microM; repaglinide, 1.6 microM), suggesting that they all share a glibenclamide binding site. The insulin responses to glucose, mitiglinide, tolbutamide, and glibenclamide in MIN6 cells after chronic mitiglinide, nateglinide, or repaglinide treatment were comparable to those after chronic tolbutamide and glibenclamide treatment. These results indicate that, similar to the sulfonylureas, mitiglinide is highly specific to the Kir6.2/SUR1 complex, i.e., the pancreatic beta-cell K(ATP) channel, and suggest that mitiglinide may be a clinically useful anti-diabetic drug.",

Bovine tracheal smooth muscle strips were incubated with 10 microM fenoterol or vehicle for various periods of time (5, 30 min, 18 h) at 37 degrees C. After extensive washout (3 h, 37 degrees C), isometric contractions were measured to the full muscarinic receptor agonist methacholine, the partial muscarinic receptor agonist 4-(m-chlorophenyl-carbamoyloxy)-2-butynyltrimethylammonium (McN-A-343) and histamine. Fenoterol treatment significantly reduced the sensitivity (pEC(50)) to methacholine in a time-dependent manner, without affecting maximal contraction (E(max)). Fenoterol treatment similarly reduced the pEC(50) of McN-A-343 and histamine; however, E(max) values were also reduced, to approximately 70% of control after 18-h treatment. The inverse agonist timolol, having no effect on control preparations, consistently restored the reduced pEC(50) and E(max) values of the contractile agonists. Remarkably, in the presence of timolol the pEC(50) values of McN-A-343 and histamine in fenoterol-treated airways were significantly enhanced compared to controls. In conclusion, fenoterol-induced constitutive beta(2)-adrenoceptor activity reduces muscarinic receptor agonist- and histamine-induced contractions of bovine tracheal smooth muscle, which can be reversed by the inverse agonist timolol. Moreover, after beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonist treatment, inverse agonism by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists may cause enhanced airway reactivity to contractile mediators.",

        "input": "PURPOSE: Testosterone-to-estradiol ratio levels in infertile men improve during treatment with the aromatase inhibitor, testolactone, and resulting changes in semen parameters. We evaluated the effect of anastrozole, a more selective aromatase inhibitor, on the hormonal and semen profiles of infertile men with abnormal baseline testosterone-to-estradiol ratios. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 140 subfertile men with abnormal testosterone-to-estradiol ratios were treated with 100 to 200 mg. testolactone daily or 1 mg. anastrozole daily. Changes in testosterone, estradiol, testosterone-to-estradiol ratios and semen parameters were evaluated during therapy. The effect of obesity, diagnosis of the Klinefelter syndrome, and presence of varicocele and/or history of varicocele repair on treatment results was studied. RESULTS: Men treated with testolactone had an increase in testosterone-to-estradiol ratios during therapy (mean plus or minus standard error of the mean 5.3 +/- 0.2 versus 12.4 +/- 1.1, p <0.001). This change was confirmed in subgroups of men with the Klinefelter syndrome, a history of varicocele repair and those with varicocele. A total of 12 oligospermic men had semen analysis before and during testolactone treatment with an increase in sperm concentration (5.5 versus 11.2 million sperm per ml., p <0.01), motility (14.7% versus 21.0%, p <0.05), morphology (6.5% versus 12.8%, p = 0.05), and motility index (606.3 versus 1685.2 million motile sperm per ejaculate, respectively, p <0.05) appreciated. During anastrozole treatment, similar changes in the testosterone-to-estradiol ratios were seen (7.2 +/- 0.3 versus 18.1 +/- 1.0, respectively, p <0.001). This improvement of hormonal parameters was noted for all subgroups except those patients with the Klinefelter syndrome. A total of 25 oligospermic men with semen analysis before and during anastrozole treatment had an increase in semen volume (2.9 versus 3.5 ml., p <0.05), sperm concentration (5.5 versus 15.6 million sperm per ml., p <0.001) and motility index (832.8 versus 2930.8 million motile sperm per ejaculate, respectively, p <0.005). These changes were similar to those observed in men treated with testolactone. No significant difference in serum testosterone levels during treatment with testolactone and anastrozole was observed. However, the anastrozole treatment group did have a statistically better improvement of serum estradiol concentration and testosterone-to-estradiol ratios (p <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Men who are infertile with a low serum testosterone-to-estradiol ratio can be treated with an aromatase inhibitor. With treatment, an increase in testosterone-to-estradiol ratio occurred in association with increased semen parameters. Anastrozole and testolactone have similar effects on hormonal profiles and semen analysis. Anastrazole appears to be at least as effective as testolactone for treating men with abnormal testosterone-to-estradiol ratios, except for the subset with the Klinefelter syndrome, who appeared to be more effectively treated with testolactone.",

To determine whether these responses were common to other amphetamines of abuse, effects of methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) on the plasmalemmal DA transporter (DAT) and vesicular monoamine transporter-2 (VMAT-2) were assessed. Similar to effects of METH reported previously, multiple high-dose MDMA administrations rapidly (within 1 h) decreased plasmalemmal DA uptake, as assessed ex vivo in synaptosomes prepared from treated rats. Unlike effects of multiple METH injections, this deficit was reversed completely 24 h after drug treatment. Also in contrast to effects of multiple METH injections, 1) MDMA caused little or no decrease in binding of the DAT ligand WIN35428, and 2) neither prevention of hyperthermia nor prior depletion of DA prevented the MDMA-induced reduction in plasmalemmal DA transport. However, a role for phosphorylation was suggested because pretreatment with protein kinase C inhibitors attenuated the deficit caused by MDMA in an in vitro model system. In addition to affecting DAT function, MDMA rapidly decreased vesicular DA transport as assessed in striatal vesicles prepared from treated rats. Unlike effects of multiple METH injections reported previously, this decrease partially recovered by 24 h after drug treatment. Taken together, these results reveal several differences between effects of MDMA and previously reported METH on DAT and VMAT-2; differences that may underlie the dissimilar neurotoxic profile of these agents.",

        "input": "The demonstration by the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast Project (NSABP) that 5 years of tamoxifen therapy is associated with an approximate 50% reduction in breast cancer incidence in high-risk women was a milestone in breast cancer prevention. Because tamoxifen is associated with increased risk of side-effects such as hot flashes, menstrual abnormalities, uterine cancer, and thromboembolic phenomena, its use will not be advisable or acceptable for all high-risk women. Women over 50 years of age appear to be at highest risk for serious adverse events, such as uterine cancer and thromboembolic phenomena. Individuals in whom tamoxifen-associated breast cancer risk reduction appears to outweigh risk of serious side-effects include women with prior in situ or estrogen receptor (ER)-positive invasive cancer, atypical hyperplasia, and/or women ages 35-49 with a calculated Gail 5-year risk of > or =1.7%, hysterectomized women aged 50 and older with a 5-year Gail risk of > or =2.5%, and nonhysterectomized women aged 50 and older with a 5-year Gail risk of >5.0%. It is not yet clear whether tamoxifen can reduce breast cancer incidence in women with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, although preliminary evidence favors benefit for at least those with a BRCA2 mutation. Raloxifene is a selective ER modulator with less uterine estrogen agonist activity than tamoxifen, and it is hoped that it will result in fewer uterine cancers but will be equally efficacious in reducing the risk of breast cancer. The NSABP is currently conducting a randomized study of tamoxifen versus raloxifene in high-risk postmenopausal women. Approximately one third of invasive cancers are ER negative. Tamoxifen does not reduce the incidence of ER-negative cancers, nor does it appear to be effective in preventing the appearance of one third of ER-positive cancers. Priorities in prevention research are to develop (a) biomarkers to refine short-term risk assessments based on epidemiologic models, (b) biomarkers predictive of response to specific classes of preventive agents, (c) drugs with fewer side-effects and/or effective in ER-negative or ER-positive tamoxifen-resistant precancerous disease, and (d) efficient clinical trial models to assess new agent efficacy. Breast intraepithelial neoplasia (IEN) may be sampled by minimally invasive techniques and is an attractive short-term risk biomarker. Molecular abnormalities observed in IEN may be used to select potential agents for testing/therapy, and modulation of these abnormalities may be used in phase I trials to select appropriate doses and in phase II trials to assess response. Breast density volume and certain serum markers such as insulin-like growth factor-1 are also being studied as potential risk and response biomarkers. Reversal or prevention of advanced IEN as well as modulation of other risk biomarkers in randomized phase II and phase III trials is being evaluated as a means of more efficiently evaluating prevention drugs in the future. A number of agents are being developed that target molecular abnormalities in IEN, have fewer or different side effects than tamoxifen, and may be effective in ER-negative or tamoxifen-resistant disease.",

In this study we infected mice with T. spiralis, a nematode parasite, and studied the inflammatory response through the determination of MIP-2, a C-X-C chemokine and MCP-1, a C-C chemokine in the inflamed area around the parasitic cyst. The animals were infected and their diaphragms were tested for inflammatory response. MCP-1 and MIP-2 was tested after 1, 10, 20, 30, and 40 days post inoculation, before and after mimosine treatment. The inflammatory index was calculated by counting the white blood cells around the nematode cysts, while expression of MIP-2 and MCP-1 was calculated by ELISA method and transcription by Northern blot and RT-PCR. Here we found that mimosine strongly inhibited the inflammatory index in the diaphragmatic tissue at 10, 20, 30 and 40 days post-treatment. In these experiments, mimosine had no effect on the number of cysts produced. In addition, we found that MCP-1 transcription and translation was completely inhibited by mimosine, while MIP-2 transcription and translation was partially inhibited at 30 and 40 days; yet it was totally inhibited after 10 and 20 days in encysted diaphragm tissue infected by T. spiralis. Our studies suggest that mimosine has an inhibitory effect through the inhibition of cytoplasmatic serine hydroxymethyltransferase altering the cell cycle of white blood cells. This study suggests for the first time the premise that mimosine acts as an anti-inflammatory compound.",

Despite accumulating evidence suggesting that neuronal membrane proteins are potential targets of inhaled anesthetics, most currently favored membrane protein targets lack any direct evidence for anesthetic binding. We report herein the location of the binding site for the inhaled anesthetic halothane at the amino acid residue level of resolution in the ligand binding cavity in a prototypical G protein-coupled receptor, bovine rhodopsin. Tryptophan fluorescence quenching and direct photoaffinity labeling with [(14)C]halothane suggested an interhelical location of halothane with a stoichiometry of 1 (halothane/rhodopsin molar ratio). Radiosequence analysis of [(14)C]halothane-labeled rhodopsin revealed that halothane contacts an amino acid residue (Trp265) lining the ligand binding cavity in the transmembrane core of the receptor. The predicted functional consequence, competition between halothane and the ligand retinal, was shown here by spectroscopy and is known to exist in vivo. These data suggest that competition with endogenous ligands may be a general mechanism of the action of halothane at this large family of signaling proteins.",

        "input": "The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the inhibitors of different PDE isoenzymes (PDE 1-5) on the production of two pro-inflammatory cytokines - tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Two in vitro models were used to compare the antiinflammatory properties of PDE inhibitors with that of glucocorticoids. The effect on TNF release from diluted human blood following lipopolysaccharide (LPS from Salmonella abortus equi) stimulation as well as the GM-CSF and TNF release from human nasal polyp cells following allergic stimulation were investigated. Both models proofed to be well suited for the characterisation of the antiinflammatory properties of new chemical entities. In diluted human blood and dispersed human nasal polyp cells the induced TNF release was most potently suppressed by selective PDE4 inhibitors. Amrinone and milrinone, selective PDE3 inhibitors, suppressed TNF secretion to a lesser extent. The effects of theophylline (unspecific PDE inhibitor), vinpocetine (PDE1 inhibitor), EHNA (PDE2 inhibitor) and the PDE5 inhibitors zaprinast and E 4021 were weak. In human blood, the tested glucocorticoids beclomethasone, dexamethasone and fluticasone inhibited the LPS induced TNF release potently in a concentration dependent manner, whereas in dispersed human nasal polyp cells, the effect of the glucocorticoids on allergically induced TNF release, with the exception of dexamethasone, was much less pronounced. Glucocorticoids were the most potent inhibitors of GM-CSF release and the effect correlates well with the affinity to the glucocorticoid receptor. The selective PDE 4 inhibitors, and to a certain extent the PDE3 inhibitors amrinone and milrinone, reduced the GM-CSF release in a concentration dependent manner. In all investigations selective PDE4 inhibitors reduced TNF release to a much higher degree (4-10 fold) than GM-CSF release.",

Adult Wistar male rats had each their third ventricle cannulated 7 days before the experiments. Injections of m-CPBG, a selective 5-HT3 receptor agonist, induced a significant increase in blood glucose in non-stressed rats in both fasted and in fed states. The same procedure was unable to modify stress-induced hyperglycemia. The hyperglycemic effect of m-CPBG central administration was blocked by pretreatment with ondansetron, a specific 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, indicating that the effects here obtained with m-CPBG were a result of its interaction with 5-HT3 receptors. Third ventricle injections of ondansetron alone were not able to modify blood glucose in non-stressed animals and did not change the hyperglycemic responses observed after immobilization stress. We conclude that pharmacological activation of the central 5-HT3 receptor induces a hyperglycemic effect in non-stressed animals.",

OBJECTIVE: We examined the effect of CysLT antagonists (pranlukast and MCI-826) on antigen inhalation-induced eosinophilia in peripheral blood and lung, and on IL-5 activity in serum during late increase of airway resistance (late asthmatic response, LAR) in sensitized guinea-pigs. METHODS: Guinea-pigs inhaled ovalbumin (OVA) + Al(OH)3 and OVA mists alternately for sensitization and challenge, respectively, once every 2 weeks. At the fifth challenge, the effects of CysLT antagonists and an anti-IL-5 antibody (TRFK-5) on the occurrence of LAR, and blood and lung eosinophilia, which appeared at 5 h after challenge, were examined. The time-course of IL-5 activity in the serum after the challenge was evaluated by measuring in vitro 'eosinophil survival prolongation activity'. The influence of CysLT antagonists on IL-5 activity was assessed. RESULTS: CysLT antagonists and TRFK-5 completely abolished blood and lung eosinophilia. LAR was suppressed by both MCI-826 and TRFK-5 by 40-50%. Sera obtained from sensitized, challenged animals 3 h and 4 h after challenge induced an obvious prolongation of eosinophil survival. The activity of the sera was completely neutralized by prior exposure to TRFK-5, suggesting that it reflected IL-5 activity. Increased IL-5 activity in the serum was inhibited by both pranlukast and MCI-826 by over 90%. CONCLUSIONS: CysLTs produced after antigen provocation sequentially induced IL-5 production from some immune component cells via CysLT1 receptor activation. Thus, it is likely that CysLTs indirectly cause antigen-induced eosinophilia through IL-5 production.",

It inhibits the activity of caspase-1, caspase-3, inducible form of nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Although minocycline does not directly inhibit these enzymes, the effects may result from interference with upstream mechanisms resulting in their secondary activation. Because the above-mentioned factors are important in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), we tested minocycline in mice with ALS. Here we report that minocycline delays disease onset and extends survival in ALS mice. Given the broad efficacy of minocycline, understanding its mechanisms of action is of great importance. We find that minocycline inhibits mitochondrial permeability-transition-mediated cytochrome c release. Minocycline-mediated inhibition of cytochrome c release is demonstrated in vivo, in cells, and in isolated mitochondria. Understanding the mechanism of action of minocycline will assist in the development and testing of more powerful and effective analogues. Because of the safety record of minocycline, and its ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier, this drug may be a novel therapy for ALS.",

        "input": "Ever since the discovery that (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-L-biopterin (BH4) is a cofactor of NOS, its function has been the object of intense research and occasional controversy. Only in the last couple of years a consensus has been reached on what constitutes the main role of BH4 in NO synthesis. In this review we aim to provide an outline of the various ways in which BH4 affects NOS catalysis. First we give a brief general description of the structure and catalytic mechanism of NOS, with special emphasis on those aspects of catalysis that are actively debated, and that directly or indirectly involve BH4. Foremost among those issues is uncoupled catalysis, i.e. the NOS-catalyzed oxidation of NADPH in the absence of substrate or pterin that does not result in NO production. We also shortly discuss the ongoing debate on whether NO is the actual reaction product of NOS catalysis, as well as the phenomenon of NO-mediated autoinhibition. We describe the function of BH4 in aromatic amino acid hydroxylation, and discuss the allosteric and structural effects that BH4 exerts on NOS. Next we turn our attention to what is now becoming accepted as the central function of BH4: its capacity to act as a 1-electron donor during reductive activation of the oxyferrous complex of the heme. Finally, we illustrate how BH4 might transform the NOS dimer into an efficient S-nitrosoglutathione synthase,and briefly touch on some more speculative aspects of the role of BH4 in NO synthesis.",

        "input": "AIMS: To compare the effects of nabumetone and meloxicam, two cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) preferential nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), on platelet COX-1 activity and platelet function. METHODS: Twelve healthy volunteers (3 male, 9 female, median age 22 years) participated in an open, randomized, cross-over trial of nabumetone 1000 mg twice daily vs meloxicam 7.5 mg twice daily during 1 week with 2 weeks wash-out. After a second 2 week wash-out period, one dose of indomethacin 50 mg was given as a positive control to check for NSAID induced inhibition of platelet function. COX-1 inhibition was measured as percentage inhibition of serum TXB2 generation in clotting whole blood, and as closure time with use of the platelet function analyser PFA-100. Data are reported as median with range. Paired variables were analysed using Wilcoxons signed rank test. RESULTS: TXB2 levels decreased significantly after all three medications, but percentage inhibition after nabumetone and indomethacin (88% and 97%, respectively) was significantly higher than after meloxicam (63%) (P<0.05). Closure times increased significantly after administration of all three medications (P<0.05). Increases in closure time after administration did not differ between nabumetone and meloxicam (24% and 14%, respectively), but were significantly larger after indomethacin administration (63%) (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In the maximum registered dosage, nabumetone inhibits thromboxane production much more than meloxicam, signifying less COX-2 selectivity of the former. However, both nabumetone and meloxicam cause only minor impairment in platelet function in comparison with indomethacin and the difference between them is not significant.",

        "input": "Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been reported to induce apoptosis in a variety of cell lines. In this study, we examined the effect of NSAIDs on the growth and apoptosis of synovial cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and analyzed the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) as a possible mechanism of action of NSAIDs. Cell proliferation and viability were assessed from 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation and by 4-[3-(4-iodophenyl)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)-2H-5-tetrazolio]-1,3-benzene disulfonate (WST-1) assay, respectively. The apoptosis of synovial cells was identified by DNA fragmentation assay and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay. Indometacin, diclofenac, oxaprozin, and zaltoprofen reduced cell proliferation and induced apoptotic cell death in synovial cells, whereas ketoprofen and acetaminophen did not. N-[2-(cyclohexyloxyl)-4-nitrophenyl]-methanesulfonamide (NS-398), a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, also inhibited cell proliferation, whereas it did not cause apoptosis. Rheumatoid synovial cells expressed PPARgamma mRNA, and the PPARgamma ligands 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J(2) and troglitazone reduced the proliferation and induced apoptosis in synovial cells. Luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that not only PPARgamma ligands but also NSAIDs, which could induce apoptosis, increased the activation of PPARgamma in synovial cells. Furthermore, the ability of NSAIDs and PPARgamma ligands to stimulate the activation of PPARgamma correlated with their ability to decrease cell viability(r = 0.92, p < 0.01) and ability to induce DNA fragmentation (r = 0.97, p < 0.001) in synovial cells. These results suggest that PPARgamma is an attractive target for induction of apoptosis in rheumatoid synovial cells and that the activation of the PPARgamma pathway is associated with the apoptotic action of NSAIDs.",

The 65 kDa isoform, GAD65 is a potent autoantigen in type 1 diabetes, whereas GAD67 is not. A hybrid cDNA was created by fusing a human cDNA for amino acids 1-101 of GAD67 to a human cDNA for amino acids 96-585 of GAD65; the recombinant (r) protein was expressed in yeast and was shown to have equivalent immunoreactivity to mammalian brain GAD with diabetes sera. We here report on enzymatic and molecular properties of rGAD67/65. METHODS: Studies were performed on enzymatic activity of rGAD67/65 by production of 3H-GABA from 3H-glutamate, enzyme kinetics, binding to the enzyme cofactor pyridoxal phosphate (PLP), stability according to differences in pH, temperature and duration of storage, and antigenic reactivity with various GAD-specific antisera. RESULTS: The properties of rGAD67/65 were compared with published data for mammalian brain GAD (brackets). These included a specific enzyme activity of 22.7 (16.7) nKat, optimal pH for enzymatic activity 7.4 (6.8), K(m) of 1.3 (1.3) mM, efficient non-covalent binding to the cofactor PLP, and high autoantigenic potency. The stability of rGAD67/65 was optimal over 3 months at -80 degrees C, or in lyophilized form at -20 degrees C.

        "input": "OBJECTIVE: Celecoxib and rofecoxib are two relatively new nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that selectively inhibit the cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) isoenzyme at therapeutic concentrations. The nephrotoxic potential of selective COX-2 inhibitors has not been clearly established. This study was conducted in order to understand the association between acute renal failure and the two COX-2 inhibitors celecoxib and rofecoxib. METHODS: A search was performed in the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) to identify cases of renal failure submitted to the FDA. A MEDLINE search of the English language literature was also performed to identify published cases of renal failure associated with celecoxib and rofecoxib. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-two and 142 domestic US cases of celecoxib and rofecoxib-associated renal failure, respectively, were identified in the AERS database. The literature search identified 19 cases of acute renal impairment in association with celecoxib and rofecoxib. In addition, drug regulatory authorities in the UK, Canada, and Australia have received about 50 reports of renal failure with celecoxib and rofecoxib. Descriptive statistics of the AERS cases have been summarised in this report. CONCLUSIONS: Data from AERS and published case reports suggest that use of both these drugs is associated with renal effects similar to that of conventional nonselective NSAIDs. Physicians should be aware that serious or life-threatening renal failure has been reported in patients with normal or impaired renal function after short-term therapy with celecoxib and rofecoxib. Patients at greatest risk for renal injury are those with pre-existing renal impairment, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and/or ACE inhibitors, and the elderly. Kidney function should be monitored closely for any signs of potential renal injuries soon after initiating treatment with these agents, especially in high-risk populations. In addition, healthcare practitioners should adequately warn patients of the signs and symptoms of serious renal toxicity, and of the need for them to see their physician promptly if they occur. Celecoxib and rofecoxib are not recommended for use in patients with advanced renal disease.",

        "input": "We have earlier demonstrated that dopamine stimulates the liberation of the prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) precursor, arachidonic acid, in Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with the rat dopamine D(2) receptor (long isoform), also without concomitant administration of a Ca(2+)-releasing agent [Nilsson et al., Br J Pharmacol 1998;124:1651-8]. In the present report, we show that dopamine, under the same conditions, also induces a concentration-dependent increase in the production of PGE(2), with a maximal effect of 235% at approximately 100 microM, and with an EC(50) of 794 nM. The effect was counteracted by the D(2) antagonist eticlopride, pertussis toxin, the inhibitor of intracellular Ca(2+) release TMB-8, incubation in Ca(2+)-free experimental medium, and PKC desensitization obtained by chronic pretreatment with the phorbol ester TPA. It was also antagonized by the non-specific cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor, indomethacin, and by the selective COX-2 inhibitor, NS-398, but not by the specific COX-1 inhibitor, valeryl salicylate. Both the non-specific phospholipase A(2) inhibitor, quinacrine, and an inhibitor of cPLA(2) and iPLA(2), AACOF3, counteracted the effect; in contrast, a selective iPLA(2) inhibitor, BEL, and a selective sPLA(2) inhibitor, TAPC, were ineffective. No effects of dopamine were obtained in control cells mock-transfected with the p3C vector only. The results reinforce previous assumptions that dopamine may interact with eicosanoid metabolism by means of D(2) receptor activation, and implicate an involvement of cPLA(2) and COX-2 in this effect. It is suggested that measurement of dopamine-induced PGE(2) production may serve as a convenient way to study D(2) receptor function in vitro.",

Presently, there are no proven effective therapies with which to safeguard the human neonatal brain against this type of injury. Minocycline, a semisynthetic tetracycline, has been shown to be neuroprotective in certain adult ischemic injury/stroke and neurodegenerative disease models. However, minocycline's neuroprotective effects have not been assessed after insults to the neonatal brain. We now report that minocycline administered either immediately before or immediately after a hypoxic-ischemic insult substantially blocks tissue damage in a rodent model of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. Minocycline treatment prevents the formation of activated caspase-3, a known effector of apoptosis, as well as the appearance of a calpain cleaved substrate, a marker of excitotoxic/necrotic cell death. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a systemic treatment that can be administered after a hypoxic-ischemic insult, which provides robust, nearly complete neuroprotection to the developing brain. Our data suggest that minocycline or a related neuroprotective tetracycline may be a candidate to consider in human clinical trials to protect the developing brain against hypoxic-ischemic-induced damage.",

        "input": "OBJECTIVE: Mutations in the cardiac sodium channel gene, SCN5A, cause congenital long QT syndrome (LQT3), Brugada syndrome, idiopathic ventricular fibrillation, and conduction disease by distinct cellular and clinical electrophysiological phenotypes. METHODS: Postmortem molecular analysis of SCN5A was conducted on an infant who presented shortly after birth with self-terminating torsades de pointes. The infant was treated with lidocaine, propranolol, and mexiletine and was stable for 16 months manifesting only a prolonged QT interval. The infant collapsed suddenly following presumed viral gastroenteritis, was found in 2:1 AV block, and was subsequently declared brain dead. Genomic DNA was subjected to SCN5A mutational analyses and DNA sequencing revealing a novel, spontaneous germline missense mutation, M1766L. The M1766L mutation was engineered into the hH1a clone by site-directed mutagenesis, transfected into embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293), and studied by voltage clamp. RESULTS: The M1766L mutation caused a significant decrease in the sodium channel expression. Co-expression with beta1 subunit, incubation at low temperature, and most effectively incubation with mexiletine partially 'rescued' the defective expression. In addition to this pronounced loss of function, M1766L also showed a 10-fold increase in the persistent late sodium current. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that M1766L-SCN5A channel dysfunction may contribute to the basis of lethal arrhythmias, displays an overlapping electrophysiological phenotype, and represents the first sodium channelopathy rescued by drug.",

Eight male human subjects each received a single 50-mg oral dose of [(14)C]valdecoxib. Urine, feces, and blood samples were collected after administration of the radioactive dose. Most of the radioactivity in plasma was associated with valdecoxib and the hydroxylated metabolite of valdecoxib (M1). The estimated terminal half-life for valdecoxib was about 7 h. About 76.1% of the radioactive dose was recovered in urine and 18% of the radioactive dose was recovered in feces. Valdecoxib was extensively metabolized in human, and nine phase I metabolites were identified. The primary oxidative metabolic pathways of valdecoxib involved hydroxylation at either the methyl group to form M1 or N-hydroxylation at the sulfonamide moiety to form M2. Further oxidation of M1 led to the formation of several other phase I metabolites. Oxidative breakdown of the N-hydroxy sulfonamide function group in M2 led to the formation of corresponding sulfinic acid and sulfonic acid metabolites. The O-glucuronide conjugate of M1 and N-glucuronide conjugate of valdecoxib were the major urinary metabolites, which accounted for 23.3 and 19.5% of the total administered dose, respectively. The remaining urinary metabolites were glucuronide conjugates of other phase I metabolites. Only 3% of the administered dose was recovered in urine as unchanged parent, suggesting that renal clearance is insignificant for valdecoxib. Absorption of valdecoxib was excellent since the recovery of unchanged valdecoxib in feces was <1% of the administered dose.",

Recently, bupropion has been reported to noncompetitively inhibit alpha3beta2, alpha3beta4, and alpha4beta2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) expressed in Xenopus oocytes or established cell lines. The present study evaluated bupropion-induced inhibition of native alpha3beta2* and alpha3beta4* nAChRs using functional neurotransmitter release assays, nicotine-evoked [(3)H]overflow from superfused rat striatal slices preloaded with [(3)H]dopamine ([(3)H]DA), and nicotine-evoked [(3)H]overflow from hippocampal slices preloaded with [(3)H]norepinephrine ([(3)H]NE). The mechanism of inhibition was evaluated using Schild analysis. To eliminate the interaction of bupropion with DAT or NET, nomifensine or desipramine, respectively, was included in the superfusion buffer. A high bupropion concentration (100 microM) elicited intrinsic activity in the [(3)H]DA release assay. However, none of the concentrations (1 nM-100 microM) examined evoked [(3)H]NE overflow and, thus, were without intrinsic activity in this assay. Moreover, bupropion inhibited both nicotine-evoked [(3)H]DA overflow (IC(50) = 1.27 microM) and nicotine-evoked [(3)H]NE overflow (IC(50) = 323 nM) at bupropion concentrations well below those eliciting intrinsic activity. Results from Schild analyses suggest that bupropion competitively inhibits nicotine-evoked [(3)H]DA overflow, whereas evidence for receptor reserve was obtained upon assessment of bupropion inhibition of nicotine-evoked [(3)H]NE overflow. Thus, bupropion acts as an antagonist at alpha3beta2* and alpha3beta4* nAChRs in rat striatum and hippocampus, respectively, across the same concentration range that inhibits DAT and NET function. The combination of nAChR and transporter inhibition produced by bupropion may contribute to its clinical efficacy as a smoking cessation agent.",

By this mechanism, they induce similar pharmacological effects to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, resulting in a lowering of blood pressure (BP). However, AT1 antagonists differ from ACE inhibitors with respect to side effects, and induce less cough, which is related to bradykinin activation. Within the class of angiotensin II antagonists, eprosartan differs from other currently clinically available agents in terms of its chemical structure and its dual pharmacological mode of action. Eprosartan acts not only at vascular AT1 receptors but also at presynaptic AT1 receptors, causing inhibition of sympathetically stimulated noradrenaline release. Eprosartan is not metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes and therefore has a low potential for metabolic drug interactions, which may be of importance when treating the elderly and patients on multiple drugs. In clinical trials eprosartan has proven to be at least as effective as the ACE inhibitor enalapril in reducing BP, but with a significantly lower incidence of side effects.

To improve their therapeutic usefulness, attempts have been made to dissociate the two main actions of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), transactivation and transrepression, which are believed to be responsible for the side effects and anti-inflammatory effects, respectively. We report here species-specific differences in the transactivation response mediated by GR. Dexamethasone (DEX), betamethasone (BM), and their esterified-derivatives had full transrepression agonistic activity in a reporter assay using CV-1 cells transfected with either human or rat GR. These GCs also had full transactivation agonistic activity in CV-1 cells transfected with human GR. The esterified-BM, however, had only partial transactivation agonistic activity in cells transfected with rat GR, whereas BM and esterified-DEX had full transactivation agonistic activity. Moreover, in rat hepatoma H4-II-E cells, the esterified-BM failed to induce tyrosine aminotransferase, which is regulated by GR-mediated transactivation activity. There were no significant differences between the binding affinity of these GCs to human and rat GR. Consistent with the weak transactivation activity of esterified-BM mediated by rat GR, there were few side effects, evaluated by thymus involution and body weight loss, in an antigen-induced asthmatic model in rats. These results suggest that the potency of esterified-BM to induce transactivation activity is different between species and that this difference is not due to differences in receptor binding.",

        "input": "Gemfibrozil, a lipid-lowering drug, inhibited cytokine-induced production of NO and the expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) in human U373MG astroglial cells and primary astrocytes. Similar to gemfibrozil, clofibrate, another fibrate drug, also inhibited the expression of iNOS. Inhibition of human iNOS promoter-driven luciferase activity by gemfibrozil in cytokine-stimulated U373MG astroglial cells suggests that this compound inhibits the transcription of iNOS. Since gemfibrozil is known to activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha), we investigated the role of PPAR-alpha in gemfibrozil-mediated inhibition of iNOS. Gemfibrozil induced peroxisome proliferator-responsive element (PPRE)-dependent luciferase activity, which was inhibited by the expression of DeltahPPAR-alpha, the dominant-negative mutant of human PPAR-alpha. However, DeltahPPAR-alpha was unable to abrogate gemfibrozil-mediated inhibition of iNOS suggesting that gemfibrozil inhibits iNOS independent of PPAR-alpha. The human iNOS promoter contains consensus sequences for the binding of transcription factors, including interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) binding to interferon-stimulated responsive element (ISRE), signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) binding to gamma-activation site (GAS), nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), activator protein-1 (AP-1), and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPbeta); therefore, we investigated the effect of gemfibrozil on the activation of these transcription factors. The combination of interleukin (IL)-1beta and IFN-gamma induced the activation of NF-kappaB, AP-1, C/EBPbeta, and GAS but not that of ISRE, suggesting that IRF-1 may not be involved in cytokine-induced expression of iNOS in human astrocytes. Interestingly, gemfibrozil strongly inhibited the activation of NF-kappaB, AP-1, and C/EBPbeta but not that of GAS in cytokine-stimulated astroglial cells. These results suggest that gemfibrozil inhibits the induction of iNOS probably by inhibiting the activation of NF-kappaB, AP-1, and C/EBPbeta and that gemfibrozil, a prescribed drug for humans, may further find its therapeutic use in neuroinflammatory diseases.",

        "input": "RATIONALE: There is substantial evidence that lisuride can produce effects linked to 5-HT(1A) receptor occupancy. Nevertheless, this action has generally been ignored in the mechanism of action of lisuride, in favor of an exclusive role for dopamine receptors in considering its antiparkinsonian effects, or an exclusive role of 5-HT(2A/2C) receptor activation in hallucinogenesis. These conclusions are surprising when one considers that the potent interaction of lisuride with 5-HT(1A) receptors has been demonstrated in several different laboratories and that activation of 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(1B) receptors can modulate dopaminergically mediated responses. OBJECTIVE: The lack of full substitution of lisuride for lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in drug discrimination experiments and induction of a pronounced 5-HT syndrome by this compound at relatively low doses convinced us to execute two series of experiments that might explain the primary mechanism responsible for lisuride-mediated biological effects and its paradoxical classification as a dopamine agonist in the literature. RESULTS: In drug discrimination studies, lisuride fully mimicked the 5-HT(1A) agonist LY 293284, only partially substituted for LSD and DOI, and failed to substitute for (+)-amphetamine. Lisuride produced a significant dose-related increase in flat body posture, forepaw treading, and lower-lip retraction which reflect a modulation of behavior by action at central 5-HT(1A) receptors. Only pMPPI [4-iodo-N-[2-[4-(methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-2-pyridynyl-benzamide hydrochloride], a selective 5-HT(1A) antagonist, was effective in inhibiting all 5-HT syndrome behaviors produced by lisuride, whereas pMPPI was without effect on any behavior induced by LSD. Lisuride dose dependently decreased body temperature in rats with a potency similar to that of the selective 5-HT(1A) agonist LY 293284. The hypothermic effect of lisuride was prevented by pre-injection of pMPPI, but not by ketanserin or haloperidol. CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated that the behavioral effects of low doses of lisuride are clearly mediated by stimulation of 5-HT(1A) receptors.",

Preclinical studies demonstrate that the therapeutic activity of citalopram resides in the S-isomer and that escitalopram binds with high affinity to the human serotonin transporter. Conversely, R-citalopram is approximately 30-fold less potent than escitalopram at this transporter. Escitalopram has linear pharmacokinetics, so that plasma levels increase proportionately and predictably with increased doses and its half-life of 27 - 32 h is consistent with once-daily dosing. In addition, escitalopram has negligible effects on cytochrome P450 drug-metabolising enzymes in vitro, suggesting a low potential for drug-drug interactions. The efficacy of escitalopram in patients with major depressive disorder has been demonstrated in multiple short-term, placebo-controlled clinical trials, three of which included citalopram as an active control, as well as in a 36-week study evaluating efficacy in the prevention of depression relapse. In these studies, escitalopram was shown to have robust efficacy in the treatment of depression and associated symptoms of anxiety relative to placebo. Efficacy has also been shown in treating generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder and social anxiety disorder. Results also suggest that, at comparable doses, escitalopram demonstrates clinically relevant and statistically significant superiority to placebo treatment earlier than citalopram. Analysis of the safety database shows a low rate of discontinuation due to adverse events, and there was no statistically significant difference between escitalopram 10 mg/day and placebo in the proportion of patients who discontinued treatment early because of adverse events. The most common adverse events associated with escitalopram which occurred at a rate greater than placebo include nausea, insomnia, ejaculation disorder, diarrhoea, dry mouth and somnolence. Only nausea occurred in > 10% of escitalopram-treated patients.",

Mice fed long term with griseofulvin are an animal model of MB formation. However, the lack of a cellular model has impeded understanding of the molecular mechanism of this process. Culture of HepG2 cells with griseofulvin has now been shown to induce both the formation of intracellular aggregates containing K18 as well as an increase in the abundance of K18 mRNA. Overexpression of K18 in HepG2, HeLa, or COS-7 cells also induced the formation of intracellular aggregates that stained with antibodies to ubiquitin and with rhodamine B (characteristics of MBs formed in vivo), eventually leading to cell death. The MB-like aggregates were deposited around centrosomes and disrupted the microtubular array. Coexpression of K8 with K18 restored the normal fibrous pattern of keratin distribution and reduced the toxicity of K18. In contrast, an NH(2)-terminal deletion mutant of K8 promoted the formation of intracellular aggregates even in the absence of K18 overexpression. Deregulated expression of K18, or an imbalance between K8 and K18, may thus be an important determinant of MB formation, which compromises the function of centrosomes and the microtubule network and leads to cell death.",

        "input": "Neuroinflammation and oxidative stress are believed to be contributing factors to neurodegeneration in normal aging, as well as in age-related neurological disorders. Reactive microglia are found in increased numbers in aging brain and are prominently associated with lesions in such age-related degenerative conditions as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In vitro, stimulated microglia or microglial-like cells secrete neurotoxic materials and are generators of free radicals through their respiratory burst system. Agents that suppress microglial activation are therefore candidates for neuroprotection. We have developed quantitative in vitro assays for measuring neurotoxicity of microglia or other mononuclear phagocytes. Neuronal like SH-SY5Y cells are cultured in supernatants from activated cells of the human monocytic THP-1 line and their survival is followed. Respiratory burst is directly measured on the activated cells. We tested inhibitors of the cyclooxygenase (COX) or the 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) pathways as possible neuroprotective agents. The COX pathway generates inflammatory prostaglandins, while the 5-LOX pathway generates inflammatory leukotrienes. We found that inhibitors of both these pathways suppressed neurotoxicity in a dose-dependent fashion. They included the COX-1 inhibitor indomethacin; the COX-2 inhibitor NS-398; the mixed COX-1/COX-2 inhibitor ibuprofen; the nitric oxide (NO) derivatives of indomethacin, ibuprofen and flurbiprofen; the 5-LOX inhibitor REV 5901; and the 5-LOX activating protein (FLAP) inhibitor MK-886. The FLAP inhibitor also reduced respiratory burst activity in a more potent manner than indomethacin. Combinations of COX and 5-LOX inhibitors were more effective than single inhibitors. The data suggest that both COX inhibitors and 5-LOX inhibitors may be neuroprotective in vivo by suppressing toxic actions of microglia/macrophages, and that combinations of the two might have greater therapeutic potential than single inhibitors of either class.",

As expected, both treatments led to serotonin depletion 1, 7 and 14 days later. However, only MDMA reduced SERT density.

We investigated the mechanism of action of atomoxetine in ADHD by evaluating the interaction of atomoxetine with monoamine transporters, the effects on extracellular levels of monoamines, and the expression of the neuronal activity marker Fos in brain regions. Atomoxetine inhibited binding of radioligands to clonal cell lines transfected with human NE, serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) transporters with dissociation constants (K(i)) values of 5, 77 and 1451 nM, respectively, demonstrating selectivity for NE transporters. In microdialysis studies, atomoxetine increased extracellular (EX) levels of NE in prefrontal cortex (PFC) 3-fold, but did not alter 5-HT(EX) levels. Atomoxetine also increased DA(EX) concentrations in PFC 3-fold, but did not alter DA(EX) in striatum or nucleus accumbens. In contrast, the psychostimulant methylphenidate, which is used in ADHD therapy, increased NE(EX) and DA(EX) equally in PFC, but also increased DA(EX) in the striatum and nucleus accumbens to the same level. The expression of the neuronal activity marker Fos was increased 3.7-fold in PFC by atomoxetine administration, but was not increased in the striatum or nucleus accumbens, consistent with the regional distribution of increased DA(EX). We hypothesize that the atomoxetine-induced increase of catecholamines in PFC, a region involved in attention and memory, mediates the therapeutic effects of atomoxetine in ADHD. In contrast to methylphenidate, atomoxetine did not increase DA in striatum or nucleus accumbens, suggesting it would not have motoric or drug abuse liabilities.",

The mutation responsible for the analogue resistance and L-proline accumulation was a single nuclear dominant mutation. By introducing the mutant-derived genomic library into a non-L-proline-utilizing strain, the mutant was found to carry an allele of the wild-type PRO1 gene encoding gamma-glutamyl kinase, which resulted in a single amino acid replacement; Asp (GAC) at position 154 was replaced by Asn (AAC). Interestingly, the allele of PRO1 was shown to enhance the activities of gamma-glutamyl kinase and gamma-glutamyl phosphate reductase, both of which catalyze the first two steps of L-proline synthesis from L-glutamate and which together may form a complex in vivo. When cultured in liquid minimal medium, yeast cells expressing the mutated gamma-glutamyl kinase were found to accumulate intracellular L-proline and showed a prominent increase in cell viability after freezing at -20 degrees C compared to the viability of cells harboring the wild-type PRO1 gene. These results suggest that the altered gamma-glutamyl kinase results in stabilization of the complex or has an indirect effect on gamma-glutamyl phosphate reductase activity, which leads to an increase in L-proline production in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The approach described in this paper could be a practical method for breeding novel freeze-tolerant yeast strains.",

The ideal antihypertensive agent should control all grades of hypertension and have a placebo-like side effect profile. Angiotensin II (AII) receptor antagonists are a relatively new class of antihypertensive agent that block AII Type 1 (AT(1)) receptors, and reduce the pressor effects of AII in the vasculature. By this mechanism, they induce similar pharmacological effects compared with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, resulting in a lowering of blood pressure. However, AII receptor blockers differ from ACE inhibitors with respect to side effects, and induce less cough, a side effect which may be related to bradykinin or other mediators such as substance P. Within the class of AII blockers, eprosartan differs from other currently available agents in terms of chemical structure, as it is a non-biphenyl, non-tetrazole, non-peptide antagonist with a dual pharmacological mode of action. Eprosartan acts at vascular AT(1) receptors (postsynaptically) and at presynaptic AT(1) receptors, where it inhibits sympathetically stimulated noradrenaline release. Its lack of metabolism by cytochrome P450 enzymes confers a low potential for metabolic drug interactions and may be of importance when treating elderly patients and those on multiple drugs. In clinical trials, eprosartan has been demonstrated to be at least as effective in reducing blood pressure as the ACE inhibitor enalapril, and has significantly lower side effects.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs including sulindac are promising chemopreventive agents for colorectal cancer. Sulindac and selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors cause regression of colonic polyps in familial polyposis patients. Sulindac induces apoptotic cell death in cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. In tumor cells, activation of extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 results in phosphorylation of several ERK1/2 effectors, including the proapoptotic protein Bad. Phosphorylation of Ser112 by ERK1/2 inactivates Bad and protects the tumor cell from apoptosis. Sulindac metabolites and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs selectively inhibit ERK1/2 phosphorylation in human colon cancer cells. In this study we show that epidermal growth factor (EGF) strongly induces phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Bad in HT29 colon cancer cells. EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of ERK and Bad is blocked by pretreatment with U0126, a selective MAP kinase kinase (MKK)1/2 inhibitor. Similarly, pretreatment with sulindac sulfide blocks the ability of EGF to induce ERK1/2 and Bad phosphorylation, but also down-regulates total Bad but not ERK1/2 protein levels.

RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: DRF 2655 was studied in different genetic, normal, and hyperlipidemic animal models. HEK 293 cells were used to conduct the reporter-based transactivation of PPARalpha and PPARgamma. To understand the biochemical mechanism of lipid-, body-weight-, and glucose-lowering effects, activities of key beta-oxidation and lipid catabolism enzymes and gluconeogenic enzymes were studied in db/db mice treated with DRF 2655. 3T3L1 cells were used for adipogenesis study, and HepG2 cells were used to study the effect of DRF 2655 on total cholesterol and triglyceride synthesis using [(14)C]acetate and [(3)H]glycerol. RESULTS: DRF 2655 showed concentration-dependent transactivation of PPARalpha and PPARgamma. In the 3T3L1 cell-differentiation study, DRF 2655 and rosiglitazone showed 369% and 471% increases, respectively, in triglyceride accumulation. DRF 2655 showed body-weight lowering and euglycemic and hypolipidemic effects in various animal models. db/db mice treated with DRF 2655 showed 5- and 3.6-fold inhibition in phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose 6-phosphatase activity and 651% and 77% increases in the beta-oxidation enzymes carnitine palmitoyltransferase and carnitine acetyltransferase, respectively. HepG2 cells treated with DRF 2655 showed significant reduction in lipid synthesis. DISCUSSION: DRF 2655 showed excellent euglycemic and hypolipidemic activities in different animal models. An exciting finding is its body-weight lowering effect in these models, which might be mediated by the induction of target enzymes involved in hepatic lipid catabolism through PPARalpha activation.",

        "input": "Appropriate expression of the GnRH receptor (GnRH-R) in gonadotropes is critical for GnRH signaling and hence for gonadotropin secretion and sexual development. In the present work, we have studied the ontogeny of the steady-state GnRH-R mRNA levels in pituitaries of male rats from Day 5 to Day 55, when sexual maturity is attained. Developmental changes of gonadotropin subunit (alpha, FSHbeta, and LHbeta) mRNA levels were also assessed. In addition, the role of the endogenous GnRH on the maturational changes of GnRH-R and gonadotropin subunit gene expression was investigated. Messenger RNA levels were determined by Northern blot analysis of total RNA from anterior pituitaries. Amounts of the most abundant (5.0 kb) GnRH-R mRNA increased slowly from Day 5 through the infantile and the juvenile periods, to peak at Day 35 (12-fold increase vs. Day 5). Thereafter, the levels of the GnRH-R mRNA decline slightly until Day 55 (33% decrease vs. Day 35). Parallel changes were observed on the 4.5-kb transcript of the GnRH-R gene. Alpha subunit mRNA was easily detected at Day 5, and its levels increased progressively through the infantile period (2.5-fold increase) and peaked at Day 25 (3.3-fold increase vs. Day 5) with a smooth nonstatistically significant increment until Day 35; then it decreased by 41.5% at Day 55. FSHbeta and LHbeta mRNA levels rose slowly until Day 25. A sharp rise occurred thereafter to reach maximum levels at Day 35 (5.8-fold for FSHbeta and 3.8-fold for LHbeta vs. Day 25). Thereafter, the levels of both mRNAs fell until Day 55 (44.1% decrease for FSHbeta and 37.1% decrease for LHbeta vs. Day 35). To ascertain whether developmental activation of the GnRH-R and gonadotropin subunit gene expression is GnRH dependent, we have studied the effect of blocking the endogenous GnRH action by treating developing male rats with the specific GnRH antagonist cetrorelix (1.5 mg/kg body weight/week, s.c.) through the infantile (Days 5-20) and the juvenile periods (Days 20-35). Cetrorelix completely blocked the rise of levels of the two most abundant species, 5.0 kb and 4.5 kb, of the GnRH-R mRNA, during both the infantile and the juvenile periods. Cetrorelix also abolished the developmental rise of the gonadotropin beta subunit mRNAs during the two periods of the study. In contrast, the alpha subunit gene expression was not altered by cetrorelix treatment during any of the two periods. These data demonstrate that sexual maturation of male rats is accompanied by a progressive and concerted induction of GnRH-R and gonadotropin subunit gene expression. Developmental activation of GnRH-R and gonadotropin beta subunit genes is GnRH dependent. The apparent GnRH-independent regulation of the alpha-glycoprotein subunit mRNA levels may be due to the contribution of thyrotropes and perhaps to the presence of exclusive regulatory signals for this gene.",

Adverse events are usually associated with the vascular changes from PDE5 inhibition. These include headache and flushing. Each of these adverse events, however, declines with medication use.

However, L-nor-okadaone (0.001 pg/mouse-1 ng/mouse, i.c.v.), an analogue of okadaic acid lacking activity against protein phosphatases, did not affect the antinociceptive effect of morphine. On the other hand, high doses of okadaic acid (10 ng/mouse, i.c.v.) and cantharidin (1 microg/mouse, i.c.v.), which also block PP1, and calyculin-A (0.1 fg/mouse-1 ng/mouse, i.c.v.), which inhibits equally both PP1 and PP2A, did not modify the morphine-induced antinociception. These results suggest that the activation of type 2A serine/threonine protein phosphatases may play a role in the antinociceptive effect of morphine, and that PP1 might counterbalace this activity.",

Fatty acid and ketone body metabolism differ considerably between monogastric and ruminant species. The regulation of the key enzymes involved may differ accordingly. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT 1) is the key locus for the control of long-chain fatty acid beta-oxidation and liver ketogenesis. Previously we showed that CPT 1 kinetics in sheep and rat liver mitochondria differ. We cloned cDNAs for both isoforms [liver- (L-) and muscle- (M-)] of ovine CPT 1 in order to elucidate the structural features of these proteins and their genes ( CPT1A and CPT1B ). Their deduced amino acid sequences show a high degree of conservation compared with orthologues from other mammalian species, with the notable exception of the N-terminus of ovine M-CPT 1. These differences were also present in bovine M-CPT 1, whose N-terminal sequence we determined. In addition, the 5'-end of the sheep CPT1B cDNA suggested a different promoter architecture when compared with previously characterized CPT1B genes. Northern blotting revealed differences in tissue distribution for both CPT1A and CPT1B transcripts compared with other species. In particular, ovine CPT1B mRNA was less tissue restricted, and the predominant transcript in the pancreas was CPT1B. Expression in yeast allowed kinetic characterization of the two native enzymes, and of a chimaera in which the distinctive N-terminal segment of ovine M-CPT 1 was replaced with that from rat M-CPT 1. The ovine N-terminal segment influences the kinetics of the enzyme for both its substrates, such that the K (m) for palmitoyl-CoA is decreased and that for carnitine is increased for the chimaera, relative to the parental ovine M-CPT 1.",

        "input": "Serine (Ser) biosynthesis in C(3) plants can occur via several pathways. One major route involves the tetrahydrofolate (THF)-dependent activities of the glycine decarboxylase complex (GDC, EC 2.1.1.10) and serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT, EC 2.1.2.1) with glycine (Gly) as one-carbon (1-C) source. An alternative THF-dependent pathway involves the C1-THF synthase/SHMT activities with formate as 1-C source. Here, we have investigated aspects of the regulation of these two folate-mediated pathways in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. Columbia using two approaches. Firstly, transgenic plants overexpressing formate dehydrogenase (FDH, EC 1.2.1.2) were used to continue our previous studies on the function of FDH in formate metabolism. The formate pool size was approximately 73 nmol (g FW)(-1) in wild type (WT) Arabidopsis plants; three independent transgenic lines had similar-sized pools of formate. Transgenic plants produced more (13)CO(2) from supplied [(13)C]formate than did WT plants but were not significantly different from WT plants in their synthesis of Ser. We concluded that FDH has no direct role in the regulation of the above two pathways of Ser synthesis; the breakdown of formate to CO(2) by the FDH reaction is the primary and preferred fate of the organic acid in Arabidopsis. The ratio between the GDC/SHMT and C1-THF synthase/SHMT pathways of Ser synthesis from [alpha-(13)C]Gly and [(13)C]formate, respectively, in Arabidopsis shoots was 21 : 1; in roots, 9 : 1. In shoots, therefore, the pathway from formate plays only a small role in Ser synthesis; in the case of roots, results indicated that the 9 : 1 ratio was as a result of greater fluxes of (13)C through both pathways together with a relatively higher contribution from the C1-THF synthase/SHMT route than in shoots. We also examined the synthesis of Ser in a GDC-deficient mutant of Arabidopsis (glyD) where the GDC/SHMT pathway was impaired. Compared with WT, glyD plants accumulated 5-fold more Gly than WT after supplying [alpha-(13)C]Gly for 24 h; the accumulation of Ser from [alpha-(13)C]Gly was reduced by 25% in the same time period. On the other hand, the accumulation of Ser through the C1-THF synthase/SHMT pathway in glyD plants was 2.5-fold greater than that in WT plants. Our experiments confirmed that the GDC/SHMT and C1-THF synthase/SHMT pathways normally operate independently in Arabidopsis plants but that when the primary GDC/SHMT pathway is impaired the alternative C1-THF synthase/SHMT pathway can partially compensate for deficiencies in the synthesis of Ser.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Of the 2 genes (MAT1A, MAT2A) encoding methionine adenosyltransferase, the enzyme that synthesizes S-adenosylmethionine, MAT1A, is expressed in liver, whereas MAT2A is expressed in extrahepatic tissues. In liver, MAT2A expression associates with growth, dedifferentiation, and cancer. Here, we identified the beta subunit as a regulator of proliferation in human hepatoma cell lines. The beta subunit has been cloned and shown to lower the K(m) of methionine adenosyltransferase II alpha2 (the MAT2A product) for methionine and to render the enzyme more susceptible to S-adenosylmethionine inhibition. METHODS: Methionine adenosyltransferase II alpha2 and beta subunit expression was analyzed in human and rat liver and hepatoma cell lines and their interaction studied in HuH7 cells. beta Subunit expression was up- and down-regulated in human hepatoma cell lines and the effect on DNA synthesis determined. RESULTS: We found that beta subunit is expressed in rat extrahepatic tissues but not in normal liver. In human liver, beta subunit expression associates with cirrhosis and hepatoma. beta Subunit is expressed in most (HepG2, PLC, and Hep3B) but not all (HuH7) hepatoma cell lines. Transfection of beta subunit reduced S-adenosylmethionine content and stimulated DNA synthesis in HuH7 cells, whereas down-regulation of beta subunit expression diminished DNA synthesis in HepG2. The interaction between methionine adenosyltransferase II alpha2 and beta subunit was demonstrated in HuH7 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that beta subunit associates with cirrhosis and cancer providing a proliferative advantage in hepatoma cells through its interaction with methionine adenosyltransferase II alpha2 and down-regulation of S-adenosylmethionine levels.",

        "input": "The amygdala is a critical brain region for limbic seizure activity, but the mechanisms underlying its epileptic susceptibility are obscure. Several lines of evidence implicate GluR5 (GLU(K5)) kainate receptors, a type of ionotropic glutamate receptor, in the amygdala's vulnerability to seizures and epileptogenesis. GluR5 mRNA is abundant in temporal lobe structures including the amygdala. Brain slice recordings indicate that GluR5 kainate receptors mediate a portion of the synaptic excitation of neurons in the rat basolateral amygdala. Whole-cell voltage-clamp studies demonstrate that GluR5 kainate receptor-mediated synaptic currents are inwardly rectifying and are likely to be calcium permeable. Prolonged activation of basolateral amygdala GluR5 kainate receptors results in enduring synaptic facilitation through a calcium-dependent process. The selective GluR5 kainate receptor agonist ATPA induces spontaneous epileptiform bursting that is sensitive to the GluR5 kainate receptor antagonist LY293558. Intra-amygdala infusion of ATPA in the rat induces limbic status epilepticus; in some animals, recurrent spontaneous seizures occur for months after the ATPA treatment. Together, these observations indicate that GluR5 kainate receptors have a unique role in triggering epileptiform activity in the amygdala and could participate in long-term plasticity mechanisms that underlie some forms of epileptogenesis. Accordingly, GluR5 kainate receptors represent a potential target for antiepileptic and antiepileptogenic drug treatments. Most antiepileptic drugs do not act through effects on glutamate receptors. However, topiramate at low concentrations causes slow inhibition of GluR5 kainate receptor-mediated synaptic currents in the basolateral amygdala, indicating that it may protect against seizures, at least in part, through suppression of GluR5 kainate receptor responses.",

        "input": "Ames dwarf mice (df/df) are deficient in growth hormone, prolactin, and thyroid-stimulating hormone and live significantly longer than their normal siblings. In the current study, we found that the hormone deficiencies affect methionine metabolism. We previously reported that the dwarf mice exhibit enzyme activities and levels that combat oxidative stress more efficiently than those of normal mice. Moreover, methionine or metabolites of methionine are involved in antioxidative processes. Thus, we performed an experiment that compared various parameters of methionine metabolism between 18-month old male dwarf (N=6) and wild type (N=5) mice. The specific activity of liver methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) was significantly elevated (205%, p<0.0001) in the dwarf mice, as were cystathionine synthase (50%, p<0.01), cystathionase (83%, p<0.001), and glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT, 91%, p<0.001) activities. Even though the activities of MAT and GNMT were elevated, the concentration of liver S-adenosylmethionine was decreased (24%, p<0.001) and S-adenosylhomocysteine increased (113%, p<0.001) in the dwarf mice. These data indicate that dwarf mice, compared to wild type mice, have a markedly different metabolism of methionine. Altered methionine metabolism may partially explain earlier reports indicating less oxidative damage to proteins in dwarf mice. Taken together, the data suggest that methionine metabolism may play a role in oxidative defense in the dwarf mouse and should be studied as a potential mechanism of extended lifespan.",

The study demonstrated that several KATI mRNAs are constitutively expressed in ubiquitous manner, while +14KATI mRNA is present only in kidney. The translational efficiency of the different transcripts was studied in vitro and enzymatic activities were measured in transiently transfected Cos-1 cells. Each KATI mRNA exhibits a different in vitro translational efficiency, which corresponds to different levels of KAT enzymatic activity in transfected cells. Both findings correlate with the predicted accessibility of the ribosomal binding sites of the different mRNAs. The structure of the rat KATI/GTK gene was also studied.

The drug has been reported to interact with various ion channel types, including AMPA/kainate receptors. In whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings from principal neurons of the rat basolateral amygdala, topiramate at low concentrations (IC50, approximately 0.5 microm) selectively inhibited pharmacologically isolated excitatory synaptic currents mediated by kainate receptors containing the GluR5 subunit. Topiramate also partially depressed predominantly AMPA-receptor-mediated EPSCs, but with lower efficacy. Topiramate did not alter the degree of facilitation in paired-pulse experiments, and it reduced the amplitude of miniature EPSCs without affecting their frequency, demonstrating that the block of synaptic responses occurs postsynaptically. Inhibition of GluR5 kainate receptors could represent a key mechanism underlying the anticonvulsant activity of topiramate. Moreover, these results support the concept that GluR5 kainate receptors represent a novel target for antiepileptic drug development.",

Therefore, a therapeutic goal in SSD is pharmacologic reactivation of HbF. Silencing of the gamma-globin (HbF) gene is associated with DNA methylation. The cytosine analog 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine) hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. We examined if subcutaneous decitabine could increase HbF levels and improve SSD pathophysiology without cytotoxicity. Eight symptomatic SSD patients resistant or intolerant of standard treatment with hydroxyurea received decitabine 0.2 mg/kg subcutaneously 1 to 3 times per week in 2 cycles of 6-week duration. Treatment decreased neutrophils and increased mean HbF (6.5% to 20.4%, P <.0001) and mean total hemoglobin (76 to 96 g/L [7.6 to 9.6 g/dL], P <.001). Features of vaso-occlusive crisis pathophysiology such as red cell adhesion, endothelial damage, and coagulation pathway activity significantly improved. gamma-Globin gene promoter methylation decreased, and platelets and the proportion of megakaryocytes and erythroid cells in the marrow increased without a decrease in marrow cellularity, consistent with a DNA hypomethylating, noncytotoxic mechanism of action. Weekly subcutaneous decitabine produces cumulative increases in HbF and total hemoglobin through a noncytotoxic mechanism of action.

Inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) have proven to be successful treatments for hypertension. As renin specifically catalyses the rate-limiting step of the RAS, it represents the optimal target for RAS inhibition. Several peptide-like renin inhibitors have been synthesized previously, but poor pharmacokinetic properties meant that these compounds were not clinically useful. We employed a combination of molecular modelling and crystallographic structure analysis to design renin inhibitors lacking the extended peptide-like backbone of earlier inhibitors, for improved pharmacokinetic properties. This led to the discovery of aliskiren, a highly potent and selective inhibitor of human renin in vitro, and in vivo; once-daily oral doses of aliskiren inhibit renin and lower blood pressure in sodium-depleted marmosets and hypertensive human patients. Aliskiren represents the first in a novel class of renin inhibitors with the potential for treatment of hypertension and related cardiovascular diseases.",

        "input": "AIM: To study the changes in the expression and phosphorylation of cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) in the rat nucleus accumbens after chronic ethanol intake and its withdrawal. METHODS: Ethanol was given in drinking water at the concentration of 6 % (v/v), for one month. Changes in the levels of CREB and phospho-CREB (p-CREB) protein in the nucleus accumbens were measured by immunohistochemistry methods. RESULTS: Ethanol given to rats in drinking water decreased the level of p-CREB protein in the nucleus accumbens (-75 %) at the time of exposure to ethanol. The decrement of p-CREB protein in the nucleus accumbens remained at 24 h (-35 %) and 72 h (-28 %) of ethanol withdrawal, which recovered toward control level after 7 d of ethanol withdrawal. However, chronic ethanol, as well as ethanol withdrawal failed to produce any significant alteration in the level of CREB protein in the nucleus accumbens. Naloxone (alone) treatment of rats had no effect on the levels of CREB and p-CREB protein in the nucleus accumbens. However, when naloxone was administered concurrently with ethanol treatment, it antagonized the down-regulation of p-CREB protein in the nucleus accumbens (142 %) of rats exposed to ethanol. CONCLUSION: A long-term intake of ethanol solution down-regulates the phosphorylation of CREB in the nucleus accumbens, and those changes can be reversed by naloxone, which may be one kind of the molecular mechanisms associated with ethanol dependence.",

        "input": "Although disturbed memory function often coexists with psychosis, the cognitive effects of antipsychotic medications with diverse pharmacodynamic properties are rarely investigated. The neurocognitive profile of zuclopenthixol, a thioxanthene dopaminergic antagonist and a conventional neuroleptic agent, has yet to be investigated despite the effect of the drug on a variety of neurotransmitter systems involved in mediation of learning and memory processes. In this study, the effect of zuclopenthixol was tested on memory retrieval 24 h after training using an inhibitory avoidance task in rats. Acute administration of zuclopenthixol (0.7 and 1.4 mg/kg i.p.) before retrieval testing increased step-through latency during the test session. The same doses of zuclopenthixol did not affect the ambulatory activity of rats in the openfield test and therefore the facilitatory effect of the drug on memory function could not be confounded with any motoric properties. This study also investigated the effect of zuclopenthixol on cortical and hippocampal monoaminergic neurotransmitters' levels together with acetylcholinesterase enzyme (AChE) activity, both of which are known to be important in control of cognitive function. Administration of zuclopenthixol (0.7 and 1.4 mg/kg i.p.) neither affected dopamine (DA) level nor AChE activity in rat cortex and hippocampus. On the other hand, the lower dose of zuclopenthixol elevated cortical norepinephrine (NE) level, while the higher dose elevated both cortical and hippocampal NE level together with hippocampal serotonin (5-HT) level. These results may suggest the involvement of adrenergic and serotonergic mechanisms in the facilitatory effect of zuclopenthixol on retrieval memory. Zuclopenthixol may therefore be a better alternative than other commonly used antipsychotic medications reported to impair cognitive function of schizophrenic patients.",

STUDY DESIGN: Sheep in preterm labor induced by RU 486 (mifepristone) received infusions of either ritodrine (n = 5) or saline solution (n = 5), and the progress of labor was monitored. beta 2-Adrenergic receptor density and function (agonist-induced cyclic adenosine monophosphate production) was measured in myometrial samples from both groups. RESULTS: Ritodrine initially inhibited labor contractions. This inhibition was only maintained for 16 hours, after which both the amplitude and frequency of electromyographic bursts and contractions returned. The failure of the myometrium to respond to ritodrine (desensitization) was associated with significant reductions in agonist-induced cyclic adenosine monophosphate production and beta 2-adrenergic receptor concentration in myometrial tissue collected from these animals compared with the saline solution-treated controls. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous infusion of ritodrine to sheep in preterm labor produces only a transient inhibition of contractions. This desensitization is caused by a down-regulation of myometrial beta 2-adrenergic receptors.",

I have studied the effects of labetalol and dilevalol on the contractile responses of the rat and guinea-pig left atria and rat portal vein. On the guinea-pig left atria low concentrations of labetalol (> or = 10(-8) M) and of dilevalol (> or = 10(-7) M) inhibited to a small extent the responses to electrical cardiac stimulation, which is indicative of membrane stabilizing activity. Labetalol (> or = 3 x 10(-8) M) and dilevalol (> or = 10(-8) M) caused surmountable antagonism of the isoprenaline responses of the atria and the pA2 values were 8.60 and 8.98 at the beta 1-adrenoceptors of the rat left atria and 7.90 and 8.31, respectively, on the guinea-pig left atria which has functional beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors. Labetalol and dilevalol (both at > or = 10(-7) M) attenuated the spontaneous contractile activity of the rat portal vein and the attenuation to labetalol at 10(-6) M was abolished by ICI 118,551 which illustrates that the labetalol-induced attenuation is beta 2-adrenoceptor mediated. The isoprenaline attenuation responses of the portal vein were inhibited by labetalol and dilevalol (both at > or = 10(-7) M) and the pA2 value for the labetalol at beta 2-adrenoceptors was 7.59.

The present studies were undertaken to determine whether stable analogues of prostacyclin, a potent endothelium-derived platelet inhibitor and vasodilator, could inhibit tissue factor expression by human monocytic cells. Exposure of monocytic tumor THP-1 cells to 100 ng/ml endotoxin, 2 units/ml interleukin-1 beta, or 5 ng/ml tumor necrosis factor-alpha for 4 hours led to increased tissue factor procoagulant activity. Preincubation for 30 minutes with iloprost, ciprostene, and carbacyclin led to a dose-dependent inhibition of tissue factor expression induced by all three challenging agents. Iloprost was the most potent: 50% inhibition occurred at 5 nM, a concentration close to the reported dissociation constant for iloprost binding to the platelet prostacyclin receptor. An orally active analogue, cicaprost, was equally effective against endotoxin-induced tissue factor expression. Carbacyclin and ciprostene were 100 times less potent. Iloprost prevented the endotoxin-induced expression of tissue factor antigen on the surface of THP-1 cells, as determined by flow cytometry. Iloprost (500 pM-50 nM) increased intracellular levels of cyclic AMP. This effect was potentiated by isobutylmethylxanthine, an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase. The inhibitory effects of iloprost on tissue factor expression were also potentiated by isobutylmethylxanthine and mimicked by forskolin and dibutyryl cyclic AMP but not dibutyryl cyclic GMP. These results suggest that prostacyclin may play a role in downregulating tissue factor expression in monocytes, at least in part via elevation of intracellular levels of cyclic AMP.",

Human type 2 preprorelaxin was coexpressed in human kidney 293 cells with the candidate prohormone convertase-processing enzymes mPC1 or mPC2, both cloned from the mouse pituitary tumor AtT-20 cell line, or with the yeast kex2 alpha-mating factor-converting enzyme from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Prorelaxin expressed alone in 293 cells was secreted into the culture medium unprocessed. Transient coexpression with mPC1 or kex2, but not with mPC2, resulted in the secretion of a low mol wt species with an electrophoretic mobility very similar, if not identical, to that of authentic mature relaxin purified from human placenta. This species was precipitable by monoclonal antibodies specific for relaxin and had a retention time on reverse phase HPLC comparable to that of relaxin.

Recent data demonstrate that the antihistaminergic activity of the racemate is primarily due to levocetirizine. Levocetirizine is rapidly and extensively absorbed, poorly metabolized, and not subject to racemization. Its pharmacokinetic characteristics are comparable after administration alone or in the racemate. Its apparent volume of distribution is smaller than that of dextrocetirizine (0.41 L kg(-1) vs. 0.60 L kg(-1)). Moreover, the non-renal (mostly hepatic) clearance of levocetirizine is also significantly lower than that of dextrocetirizine (11.8 mL min(-1) vs. 29.2 mL min(-1)).

The PA concentration required to induce 25% [ED25] of the maximally inducible Pli-activity in plasma (= 1 U/mL = 45 mg/L = 0.53 micromol/L active Pli; deltaA = 363 +/- 8 mA/h RT) after 10 minutes (37 degrees C) were 320 IU/mL u-PA, 8 microg/mL t-PA, 140 U/mL PSAC, 6,000 IU/mL SK, 720 U/mL RP, and approximately 150 microg/mL TP. The approximate activity half-lives of the PA in plasma were 30 minutes for u-PA, 30 minutes for t-PA, greater than 80 minutes for SK, greater than 80 minutes for PSAC, 50 minutes for RP, and 80 minutes for TP. The present study shows--for the first time--a combined kinetic in vitro simulation of the plasmatic activity of six different PAs. At clinically used concentrations, RP induces the highest plasmatic Pli activity. Due to unselective generation of plasmin in plasma, all PA are of some danger in inducing severe hemorrhagias. Clinical thrombolysis might be improved by usage of more physiologic activators of thrombolysis, such as activators of polymorphonuclear neutrophils.",

        "input": "PURPOSE: To evaluate the effects of INS37217 on the recovery of retinal function after experimental retinal detachment induced by subretinal injection. METHODS: Subretinal injections of 1 micro L of fluorescent microbeads, saline, or INS37217 (1-200 micro M) were made by the transvitreal method in normal (C57BL/6) mice and in mice heterozygous for the retinal degeneration slow (rds) gene. Control, mock-injected animals underwent corneal puncture without injection. Histologic and ERG evaluations were made at 0 to 1 and 8 hours, and 1, 3, 7, 10, 14, and 60 days post injection (PI). DNA fragmentation was evaluated by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated uridine 5'-triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL). RESULTS: A single subretinal injection of saline solution containing fluorescent beads caused a histologically evident retinal detachment and distributed the microbeads to almost all the subretinal space. Spontaneous reattachment occurred within 24 hours after injection and was accompanied by evident retinal folding that appeared largely resolved by 6 days later. Relative to controls, injection of saline resulted in approximately 40% recovery of dark-adapted a-wave amplitude at 24 hours PI and gradually improved to approximately 90% of controls at 2 months PI. Subretinal injection of saline containing INS37217 (10 micro M) significantly increased rod and cone ERG of normal and rds(+/-) mice at 1 and 10 days PI, when compared with injection of saline alone. Additionally, INS37217 reduced the number of TUNEL-positive photoreceptors and the enhanced rate of reattachment. CONCLUSIONS: Enhancement of ERG recovery by INS37217 is likely due to reduced retinal folding and cell death associated with detachment. These results support the use of INS37217 to help restore function after therapies that involve subretinal administration of drugs in animal models of retinal diseases.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: The intravenous anesthetic etomidate exhibits structural similarities to specific alpha2-adrenoceptor agonists of the type such as dexmedetomidine. The current study was performed to elucidate the possible interaction of etomidate with alpha2-adrenoceptors in mice lacking individual alpha2-adrenoceptor subtypes (alpha2-KO). METHODS: Sedative and cardiovascular responses to etomidate and the alpha2-agonist, dexmedetomidine, were determined in mice deficient in alpha2-receptor subtypes. Inhibition of binding of the alpha2-receptor antagonist [3H]RX821002 to recombinant alpha2-receptors by etomidate was tested in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells in vitro. RESULTS: In vivo, loss and recovery of the righting reflex required similar times after intraperitoneal injection of etomidate in wild-type and in alpha2A-receptor-deficient mice, indicating that the hypnotic effect of etomidate in mice does not require the alpha2A-receptor subtype. Intravenous injection of etomidate resulted in a transient increase (duration 2.4 +/- 0.2 min) in arterial blood pressure in wild-type mice (17 +/- 3 mmHg). Etomidate did not affect blood pressure in alpha2B-KO or alpha2AB-KO mice. In membranes from HEK293 cells transfected with alpha2-receptors, etomidate inhibited binding of the alpha2-antagonist, [3H]RX821002, with higher potency from alpha2B- and alpha2C-receptors than from alpha2A-receptors (Ki alpha2A 208 microm, alpha2B 26 microm, alpha2C 56 microm). In alpha2B-receptor-expressing HEK293 cells, etomidate rapidly increased phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-related kinases ERK1/2. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that etomidate acts as an agonist at alpha2-adrenoceptors, which appears in vivo primarily as an alpha2B-receptor-mediated increase in blood pressure. This effect of etomidate may contribute to the cardiovascular stability of patients after induction of anesthesia with etomidate.",

        "input": "Cells respond to physiological stress by phosphorylating the alpha subunit of the translation initiation factor eIF2. This adaptive response inhibits protein synthesis and up-regulates genes essential for cell survival. Cat-1, the transporter for the essential amino acids, arginine and lysine, is one of the up-regulated genes. We previously showed that stress increases cat-1 expression by coordinated stabilization of the mRNA and increased mRNA translation. This induction is triggered by amino acid depletion and the unfolded protein response (UPR), which is caused by unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. We show here that cat-1 gene transcription is also increased by cellular stress. Our studies demonstrate that the cat-1 gene promoter/regulatory region is TATA-less and is located in a region that includes 94 bases of the first exon. Transcription from this promoter is stimulated 8-fold by cellular stress. An amino acid response element within the first exon is shown to be required for the response to amino acid depletion but not to the UPR. The stimulation of transcription by amino acid depletion requires activation of GCN2 kinase, which phosphorylates eIF2alpha. This phosphorylation also induces translation of the cat-1 mRNA, demonstrating that stress-induced transcriptional and translational control of cat-1 are downstream targets of a signaling pathway initiating with eIF2alpha phosphorylation. Our studies show that the increase in cat-1 gene expression by cellular stress involves at least three types of coordinate regulation: regulation of transcription, regulation of mRNA stability, and regulation of mRNA translation.",

        "input": "Memantine has been demonstrated to be safe and effective in the symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). While the neurobiological basis for the therapeutic activity of memantine is not fully understood, the drug is not a cholinesterase inhibitor and, therefore, acts differently from current AD therapies. Memantine can interact with a variety of ligand-gated ion channels. However, NMDA receptors appear to be a key target of memantine at therapeutic concentrations. Memantine is an uncompetitive (channel blocking) NMDA receptor antagonist. Like other NMDA receptor antagonists, memantine at high concentrations can inhibit mechanisms of synaptic plasticity that are believed to underlie learning and memory. However, at lower, clinically relevant concentrations memantine can under some circumstances promote synaptic plasticity and preserve or enhance memory in animal models of AD. In addition, memantine can protect against the excitotoxic destruction of cholinergic neurons. Blockade of NMDA receptors by memantine could theoretically confer disease-modifying activity in AD by inhibiting the \"weak\" NMDA receptor-dependent excitotoxicity that has been hypothesized to play a role in the progressive neuronal loss that underlies the evolving dementia. Moreover, recent in vitro studies suggest that memantine abrogates beta-amyloid (Abeta) toxicity and possibly inhibits Abeta production. Considerable attention has focused on the investigation of theories to explain the better tolerability of memantine over other NMDA receptor antagonists, particularly those that act by a similar channel blocking mechanism such as dissociative anesthetic-like agents (phencyclidine, ketamine, MK-801). A variety of channel-level factors could be relevant, including fast channel-blocking kinetics and strong voltage-dependence (allowing rapid relief of block during synaptic activity), as well as reduced trapping (permitting egress from closed channels). These factors may allow memantine to block channel activity induced by low, tonic levels of glutamate--an action that might contribute to symptomatic improvement and could theoretically protect against weak excitotoxicity--while sparing synaptic responses required for normal behavioral functioning, cognition and memory.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Rivastigmine is a carbamate drug designed to inhibit both acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase by reversibly covalently bonding to these enzymes. Butyrylcholinesterase in-creases as Alzheimer disease progresses, so its inhibition may become more important as the disease worsens. Metabolism of rivastigmine occurs at the synapse rather than at the liver and previous studies have demonstrated no drug-drug interactions. Rivastigmine has a half-life at the synapse of 9 hours allowing for bid dosing. REVIEW SUMMARY: Effective therapy requires up-titration from initial dosage of 3 mg/d to 6 mg/d with additional increases to 9 mg or 12 mg/d giving additional benefits in some patients. Beneficial effects with rivastigmine therapy in the functioning of activities of daily living, behavior, cognition, and global functioning have been demonstrated in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease in 4 large double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trials. Potential adverse effects of nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea in these original Alzheimer trials with rapid (every week) dosage increases occurred in up to 34% of patients and can be minimized by slower monthly up-titrations. Rivastigmine also was proven effective in decreasing psychiatric symptoms and cognitive deficits in a large double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with diffuse Lewy body disease. Other studies have suggested that rivastigmine improves symptoms in nursing home patients with more severe stage Alzheimer disease, Parkinson dementia, and subcortical dementia. Follow-up studies have suggested that rivastigmine may delay disease progression and, in patients discontinuing the drug, no withdrawal effects were seen. CONCLUSION: Rivastigmine is an effective therapeutic agent for treating cognitive and behavioral symptoms in Alzheimer disease and diffuse Lewy body disease and may also have beneficial effects in vascular and Parkinson dementias.",

        "input": "The choroid plexus uptake of [(3)H]cefadroxil was studied in peptide transporter 2 (PEPT2) wild-type and null mice as a function of temperature, transport inhibitors, pH, and saturability. At normal pH (7.4) and temperature (37 degrees C), the uptake of 1 microM cefadroxil was reduced by 83% in PEPT2(-/-) mice as compared with PEPT2(+/+) mice (p < 0.001). A further reduction was achieved in null animals by reducing the temperature to 4 degrees C, or by adding saturating concentrations of unlabeled cefadroxil or p-aminohippurate (p < 0.05). Glycylsarcosine coadministration could inhibit the uptake of cefadroxil in PEPT2(+/+) mice (p < 0.01) but not PEPT2(-/-) mice. Although a proton-stimulated uptake of cefadroxil was demonstrated in PEPT2(+/+) mice (pH 6.5 versus pH 7.4; p < 0.01), no pH dependence was observed in PEPT2(-/-) mice. Kinetic parameters for cefadroxil (without p-aminohippurate) in wild-type mice were: V(max) = 5.4 pmol/mg/min, K(m) = 34 microM, and K(d) = 0.0069 microl/mg/min; in the presence of p-aminohippurate, the parameters were: V(max) = 4.1 pmol/mg/min, K(m) = 27 microM, and K(d) = 0.0064 microl/mg/min. In null animals, the kinetic parameters of cefadroxil (without p-aminohippurate) were: V(max) = 2.7 pmol/mg/min, K(m) = 110 microM, and K(d) = 0.0084 microl/mg/min; in the presence of p-aminohippurate, only a K(d) = 0.010 microl/mg/min was observed. Based on kinetic and inhibitor analyses, it was determined that (under linear conditions), 80 to 85% of cefadroxil's uptake in choroid plexus is mediated by PEPT2, 10 to 15% by organic anion transporter(s), and 5% by nonspecific mechanisms. These findings demonstrate that PEPT2 is the primary transporter responsible for cefadroxil uptake in the choroid plexus.

Molecular analysis of these mutants revealed single base pair exchanges in the ERG1 gene coding for squalene epoxidase, the target of terbinafine. The mutants did not show cross-resistance to any of the substrates of various pleiotropic drug resistance efflux pumps tested. The ERG1 mRNA levels in the mutants did not differ from those in the wild-type parent strains. Terbinafine resistance was transmitted with the mutated alleles in gene replacement experiments, proving that single amino acid substitutions in the Erg1 protein were sufficient to confer the resistance phenotype. The amino acid changes caused by the point mutations were clustered in two regions of the Erg1 protein. Seven mutants carried the amino acid substitutions F402L (one mutant), F420L (one mutant), and P430S (five mutants) in the C-terminal part of the protein; and three mutants carried an L251F exchange in the central part of the protein. Interestingly, all exchanges identified involved amino acids which are conserved in the squalene epoxidases of yeasts and mammals. Two mutations that were generated by PCR mutagenesis of the ERG1 gene and that conferred terbinafine resistance mapped in the same regions of the Erg1 protein, with one resulting in an L251F exchange and the other resulting in an F433S exchange.

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Beta2-adrenergic receptors (beta2AR) play important regulatory roles in a variety of cells and organ systems and are important therapeutic targets in the treatment of airway and cardiovascular disease. Prolonged use of beta-agonists results in tolerance secondary to receptor down-regulation resulting in reduced therapeutic efficiency. The purpose of this work is to evaluate the signaling capabilities of the beta2AR expressed by a recombinant adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector that also included an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene (AAV-beta2AR/EGFP). RESULTS: By epifluorescence microscopy, approximately 40% of infected HEK 293 cells demonstrated EGFP expression. beta2AR density measured with [3H]dihydroalprenolol ([3H]DHA) increased either 13- or 77-fold in infected cells compared to mock infected controls depending on the culture conditions used. The [3H]DHA binding was to a single receptor population with a dissociation constant of 0.42 nM, as would be expected for wild-type beta2AR. Agonist competition assays with [3H]DHA showed the following rank order of potency: isoproterenol>epinephrine> norepinephrine, consistent with beta2AR interaction. Isoproterenol-stimulated cyclic AMP levels were 5-fold higher in infected cells compared to controls (314 +/- 43 vs. 63.4 +/- 9.6 nmol/dish; n = 3). Receptor trafficking demonstrated surface expression of beta2AR with vehicle treatment and internalization following isoproterenol treatment. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that HEK 293 cells infected with AAV-beta2AR/EGFP effectively express beta2AR and that increased expression of these receptors results in enhanced beta2AR signaling.

        "input": "OBJECTIVE: To examine the influence of carvedilol dose and concentration in serum on plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), a measure of heart failure progression. METHODS: 12 patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II-III chronic heart failure were enrolled in the study. They received carvedilol at daily doses of 1-20 mg with a 1-2 weekly adjustment. Serum carvedilol trough concentrations were measured in steady-state using a specific fluorescence HPLC method. The degree of improvement in heart failure was assessed from the ratio of change in the plasma BNP concentration, 2 weeks, 1 month and 3 months after the commencement of carvedilol administration. RESULTS: From the pharmacokinetic aspect, there was no valid correlation between the trough serum carvedilol concentration (Cmin) and daily dose per body weight (Dd/BW), indicating that there was a wide difference in the carvedilol elimination capacity among individuals. A significant decrease in the BNP was observed at the 3rd month in patients treated with the high dose (> 750 mg/3 months). On the other hand, in patients with a mean serum carvedilol level (Cmin) of less than 2.5 nmol/l up to 2 weeks after the start ofcarvedilol therapy, the degree of reduction in the BNP value after the 3rd month was significantly larger, relative to the patient group with Cmin over 2.5 nmol/l. CONCLUSIONS: The total carvedilol dose was confirmed to be one of the determinants for improvement in heart failure, and it was suggested that the initial serum level also plays an important role in therapeutic outcome. Therefore, it may be important to monitor the serum carvedilol level at the introductory period to determine the daily dose requirements because of the wide inter-individual variability in its metabolic clearance.",

The model includes 607 of the 773 amino acids of L-CPT I, and the positions of carnitine, CoA and the palmitoyl group were assigned by superposition and docking analysis. Functional analysis of this 3-D model included the mutagenesis of several amino acids in order to identify putative catalytic residues. Mutants D477A, D567A and E590D showed reduced L-CPT I activity. In addition, individual mutation of amino acids forming the conserved Ser685-Thr686-Ser687 motif abolished enzyme activity in mutants T686A and S687A and altered K(m) and the catalytic efficiency for carnitine in mutant S685A. We conclude that the catalytic residues are His473 and Asp477, while Ser687 probably stabilizes the transition state.

        "input": "TAS-102 is a new oral anti-cancer drug preparation, composed of a 1:0.5 mixture (on a molar basis) of alpha,alpha,alpha-trifluorothymidine (FTD) and 5-chloro-6-[1-(2-iminopyrrolidinyl)methyl]-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione hydrochloride (TPI). TAS-102 currently undergoing clinical trials, has been demonstrated to have at least two mechanisms, inhibition of TS and incorporation into DNA. We hypothesized that the thymidine metabolism enzyme may be a crucial factor that affects the antitumor activity of TAS-102. In the present study, we measured the enzyme activity of thymidine kinase (TK), thymidine phosphorylase (TP) and thymidilate synthase (TS) in human cancer xenografts to investigate the contribution of these enzymes to the sensitivity of TAS-102. Antitumor activity of TAS-102 appears to be associated with TK, tumor growth and TS. However, the most related factors in this study were the TK and TP ratio. There was a significant correlation (p=0.04) between tumor growth inhibition and this ratio. These results suggested that the activation and degradation pattern of FTD plays an important role in the efficacy of TAS-102 and that it is possible to use the TK/TP ratio to predict response to TAS-102 therapy. We also studied the influence of TPI on the capacity of exogenous dThd to reverse FTD-dependent growth inhibition. Thymidine (dThd) levels rescued the effect of FTD in vitro and significantly increased in serum after administration of TAS-102 or TPI alone but not FTD alone. This may suggest the possibility of a decrease in antitumor effect. However, our study indicated that the therapeutic index was clearly increased by FTD combined with TPI, compared with FTD alone, suggesting FTD-induced toxicity to sensitive host tissue can be selectively reversed with dThd. In conclusion, TK and TPI effects on TP play important roles in the cytotoxic action of TAS-102, and it is possible to use the TK/TP ratio to predict more precisely individual resistance or sensitivity.",

This isomer contains two chiral centres and is being developed as an inhaled preparation for the treatment of respiratory disorders. Sepracor believes that arformoterol has the potential to be a once-daily therapy with a rapid onset of action and a duration of effect exceeding 12 hours. In 1995, Sepracor acquired New England Pharmaceuticals, a manufacturer of metered-dose and dry powder inhalers, for the purpose of preparing formulations of levosalbutamol and arformoterol. Phase II dose-ranging clinical studies of arformoterol as a longer-acting, complementary bronchodilator were completed successfully in the fourth quarter of 2000. Phase III trials of arformoterol began in September 2001. The indications for the drug appeared to be asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, an update of the pharmaceutical product information on the Sepracor website in September 2003 listed COPD maintenance therapy as the only indication for arformoterol. In October 2002, Sepracor stated that two pivotal phase III studies were ongoing in 1600 patients. Sepracor estimates that its NDA submission for arformoterol, which is projected for the first half of 2004, will include approximately 3000 adult subjects. Sepracor stated in July 2003 that it had completed more than 100 preclinical studies and initiated or completed 15 clinical studies for arformoterol inhalation solution for the treatment of bronchospasm in patients with COPD. In addition, Sepracor stated that the two pivotal phase III studies in 1600 patients were still progressing. In 1995, European patents were granted to Sepracor for the use of arformoterol in the treatment of asthma, and the US patent application was pending.",

We now show that heregulin (HRG), but not EGF, stimulates p95ErbB2 phosphorylation in BT474 breast cancer cells. Furthermore, phospho-p95ErbB2 forms heterodimers with ErbB3, but not EGFR, while p185ErbB2 heterodimerizes with both EGFR and ErbB3. The predilection of p95ErbB2 to heterodimerize with ErbB3 provides an explanation for its regulation by HRG, an ErbB3 ligand. GW572016, a reversible small molecule inhibitor of EGFR and ErbB2 tyrosine kinases, inhibits baseline p95ErbB2 phosphorylation in BT474 cells and tumor xenografts. Inhibition of p95ErbB2, p185ErbB2, and EGFR phosphorylation by GW572016 resulted in the inhibition of downstream phospho-Erk1/2, phospho-AKT, and cyclin D steady-state protein levels. Increased phosphorylation of p95ErbB2 and AKT in response to HRG was abrogated to varying degrees by GW572016. In contrast, trastuzumab did not inhibit p95ErbB2 phosphorylation or the expression of downstream phospho-Erk1/2, phospho-AKT, or cyclin D. It is tempting to speculate that trastuzumab resistance may be mediated in part by the selection of p95ErbB2-expressing breast cancer cells capable of exerting potent growth and prosurvival signals through p95ErbB2-ErbB3 heterodimers. Thus, p95ErbB2 represents a target for therapeutic intervention, and one that is sensitive to GW572016 therapy.",

Isoprenaline was a full inotropic agonist at rat ventricular myocytes (pD(2) 7.69+/-0.12).

        "input": "PURPOSE: We provide a comprehensive overview of the role of alpha1-adrenergic receptors (alpha1ARs) as critical mediators of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and pathophysiology in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and we review the pharmacological antagonists of alpha1ARs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A review was performed of pertinent studies in the literature relating to the pathophysiology of LUTS and BPH, focusing on the role of alpha1ARs, and of clinical trial and practice data evaluating the different agents that inhibit these receptors. RESULTS: Further characterization of the alpha1AR gene family indicates that 3 receptor subtypes exist in humans. Their different distribution between urinary tract and cardiovascular tissues has provided a strategy for the development of improved therapeutic agents. Since excessive activity of the alpha1aAR and alpha1dAR subtypes appears to be a common feature in symptomatic BPH and alpha1aARs are enriched in prostatic tissue, drugs that demonstrate high alpha1aAR selectivity have attracted attention. Tamsulosin, which has high affinity for alpha1aAR and alpha1dAR subtypes but not for alpha1bAR, shows efficacy similar to the nonsubtype selective agents terazosin and doxazosin. It is associated with fewer cardiovascular side effects, although it has some ejaculatory side effects. The nonsubtype selective agent alfuzosin also demonstrates efficacy and offers an enhanced side effect profile, particularly minimizing hypotension. Other agents with super selective specificity for the alpha1aAR subtype are under investigation. CONCLUSIONS: Further advances in the treatment of LUTS associated with BPH may depend not only on receptor subtype selectivity, but also on other pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors.",

        "input": "Combination chemotherapy regimens have emerged as the standard approach in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. Meta-analyses have demonstrated a 2-month increase in median survival after platinum-based therapy vs. best supportive care, and an absolute 10% improvement in the 1-year survival rate. Just as importantly, cytotoxic therapy has produced benefits in symptom control and quality of life. Newer agents, including the taxanes, vinorelbine, gemcitabine, and irinotecan, have expanded our therapeutic options in the treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. Despite their contributions, we have reached a therapeutic plateau, with response rates seldom exceeding 30-40% in cooperative group studies and 1-year survival rates stable between 30% and 40%. It is doubtful that substituting one agent for another in various combinations will lead to any further improvement in these rates. The thrust of current research has focused on targeted therapy, and epidermal growth factor receptor inhibition is one of the most promising clinical strategies. Epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors currently under investigation include the small molecules gefitinib (Iressa, ZD1839) and erlotinib (Tarceva, OSI-774), as well as monoclonal antibodies such as cetuximab (IMC-225, Erbitux). Agents that have only begun to undergo clinical evaluation include CI-1033, an irreversible pan-erbB tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and PKI166 and GW572016, both examples of dual kinase inhibitors (inhibiting epidermal growth factor receptor and Her2). Preclinical models have demonstrated synergy for all these agents in combination with either chemotherapy or radiotherapy, leading to great enthusiasm regarding their ultimate contribution to lung cancer therapy. However, serious clinical challenges persist. These include the identification of the optimal dose(s); the proper integration of these agents into popular, established cytotoxic regimens; and the selection of the optimal setting(s) in which to test these compounds. Both gefitinib and erlotinib have shown clinical activity in pretreated, advanced non-small-cell lung cancer, but placebo-controlled randomized Phase III studies evaluating gefitinib in combination with standard cytotoxic therapy, to our chagrin, have failed to demonstrate a survival advantage compared with chemotherapy alone.",

We induced apoptosis with staurosporine in four Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines that are deficient in PSS1 and/or PSS2 to determine if PtdSer generated by either of these enzymes is required for externalization on the cell surface during apoptosis. The onset of apoptosis was confirmed by the appearance of morphological changes and DNA fragmentation while the plasma membrane remained largely intact. In all cell lines, regardless of their content of PSS1 and/or PSS2, apoptosis occurred to approximately the same extent, and within approximately the same time frame, as in parental CHO-K1 cells. The exposure of PtdSer on the cell surface was assessed by annexin V labeling and flow cytometry. Cells that were deficient in either PSS1 or PSS2, as well as cells that were deficient in both PSS1 and PSS2, externalized normal amounts of PtdSer. Our study demonstrates, that reduction of in vitro serine-exchange activity, even by 97%, does not restrict the externalization of PtdSer during apoptosis.

Phenytoin (diphenylhydantoin, DPH) is an established sodium channel blocker and is a useful anticonvulsant and class 1b antiarrhythmic, and has been effectively used in the treatment of neuropathic pain. In this study, we have synthesized novel alpha-hydroxyphenylamide analogues of diphenylhydantoin and examined their ability to inhibit human Na(V)1.5 sodium channels expressed in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO-K1) cells. Phenyl ring substitutions were examined including para-methyl, para-fluoro, para-chloro, ortho-chloro and meta-chloro. We have found that phenyl ring substitutions with electron withdrawing properties resulted in compounds with greater activity. In comparison to diphenylhydantoin, the novel chloro-substituted alpha-hydroxyphenylamide compounds produced as much as a 20-fold greater tonic and frequency-dependent blockade of Na(V)1.5 channels with an IC(50) value of 14.5 microM. In addition, the chloro-substitutions have position specific state dependent blocking properties. The ortho-, meta- and para-chloro substitutions have an 8-, 13- and 3-fold increased affinity for the inactivated state, respectively. Molecular modeling suggests that these differences in affinity are due to a direct interaction with the receptor.

To investigate the mechanism and consequences of inhibition of QR2 by the quinolines further, we have used steady-state and transient-state kinetics to define the mechanism of QR2. Importantly, we have shown that QR2 when isolated from an overproducing strain of E. coli is kinetically equivalent to the enzyme from the native human red blood cell source. We observe ping-pong kinetics consistent with one substrate/inhibitor binding site that shows selectivity for the oxidation state of the FAD cofactor, suggesting that selective inhibition of the liver versus red blood cell forms of malaria may be possible. The reductant N-methyldihydronicotinamide and the inhibitor primaquine bind exclusively to the oxidized enzyme. In contrast, the inhibitors quinacrine and chloroquine bind exclusively to the reduced enzyme. The quinone substrate menadione, on the other hand, binds nonspecifically to both forms of the enzyme. Single-turnover kinetics of the reductive half-reaction are chemically and kinetically competent and confirm the inhibitor selectivity seen in the steady-state experiments.

        "input": "In determining the biological profiles of various antiprogestins, it is important to assess the hormonal and antihormonal activity, selectivity, and potency of their proximal metabolites. The early metabolism of mifepristone is characterized by rapid demethylation and hydroxylation. Similar initial metabolic pathways have been proposed for CDB-2914 (CDB: Contraceptive Development Branch of NICHD) and CDB-4124, and their putative metabolites have been synthesized. We have examined the functional activities and potencies, in various cell-based assays, and relative binding affinities (RBAs) for progesterone receptors (PR) and glucocorticoid receptors (GR) of the putative mono- and didemethylated metabolites of CDB-2914, CDB-4124, and mifepristone and of the 17alpha-hydroxy and aromatic A-ring derivatives of CDB-2914 and CDB-4124. The binding affinities of the monodemethylated metabolites for rabbit uterine PR and human PR-A and PR-B were similar to those of the parent compounds. Monodemethylated mifepristone bound to rabbit thymic GR with higher affinity than monodemethylated CDB-2914 or CDB-4124. T47D-CO cells were used to assess inhibition of R5020-stimulated endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity and transactivation of the PRE(2)-thymidine kinase (tk)-luciferase (LUC) reporter plasmid in transient transfections. The antiprogestational potency was as follows: mifepristone/CDB-2914/CDB-4124/monodemethylated metabolites (IC(50)'s approximately 10(-9)M) > aromatic A-ring derivatives (IC(50)'s approximately 10(-8)M) > didemethylated/17alpha-hydroxy derivatives (IC(50)'s approximately 10(-7)M). Antiglucocorticoid activity was determined by inhibition of dexamethasone-stimulated transcriptional activity in HepG2 cells. The mono- and didemethylated metabolites of CDB-2914 and CDB-4124 had less antiglucocorticoid activity (IC(50)'s approximately 10(-6)M) than monodemethylated mifepristone (IC(50) approximately 10(-8)M) or the other test compounds. At 10(-6)M in transcription assays, none of these compounds showed progestin agonist activity, whereas mifepristone and its monodemethylated metabolite manifested slight glucocorticoid agonist activity. The reduced antiglucocorticoid activity of monodemethylated CDB-2914 and CDB-4124 was confirmed in vivo by the thymus involution assay in adrenalectomized male rats. The aromatic A-ring derivatives-stimulated transcription of an estrogen-responsive reporter plasmid in MCF-7 and T47D-CO human breast cancer cells but were much less potent than estradiol. Taken together, these data suggest that the proximal metabolites of mifepristone, CDB-2914, and CDB-4124 contribute significantly to the antiprogestational activity of the parent compounds in vivo. Furthermore, the reduced antiglucocorticoid activity of CDB-2914 and CDB-4124 compared to mifepristone in vivo may be due in part to decreased activity of their putative proximal metabolites.",

        "input": "OBJECTIVE: Ziprasidone is an atypical antipsychotic drug that shows a higher affinity for serotonin 5-HT(2) receptors compared with dopamine D(2) receptors in vitro. The affinity of ziprasidone for these receptors in vivo in patients was examined in a positron emission tomography (PET) study. METHOD: The authors conducted a PET study to evaluate D(2) occupancy (using [(11)C]raclopride) and 5-HT(2) occupancy (using [(18)F]setoperone) in brain regions of interest in 16 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder randomly assigned to receive 40, 80, 120, or 160 mg/day of ziprasidone, which reflected the recommended dose range. PET scanning was done after 3 weeks of administration and at trough plasma levels, i.e., 12-16 hours after the last dose. RESULTS: The mean 5-HT(2) receptor occupancy was significantly higher than the mean D(2) receptor occupancy (mean=76%, SD=15%, and mean=56%, SD=18%, respectively). The estimated plasma ziprasidone concentration associated with 50% maximal 5-HT(2) receptor occupancy was almost four times lower than that for D(2) receptor occupancy. CONCLUSIONS: These data affirm that ziprasidone is similar to other novel antipsychotics in having greater 5-HT(2) than D(2) receptor occupancy at therapeutic doses and suggest that the optimal effective dose of ziprasidone is closer to 120 mg/day than to the lower doses suggested by previous PET studies. The relatively high D(2) receptor occupancy, even at trough plasma levels, suggests that ziprasidone is more similar to risperidone and olanzapine in receptor occupancy profile than to clozapine and quetiapine. Since ziprasidone plasma levels show significant (more than twofold) variation within a single dose cycle, studies that are aimed at peak plasma levels (6 hours after the last dose) and that examine extrastriatal regions are required to fully characterize the in vivo occupancy profile of ziprasidone.",

PKC isoforms did show different sensitivity and selectivity for down-regulation by I3A and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) in WEHI-231, HOP-92, and Colo-205 cells. In all of the three cell types, I3A inhibited cell proliferation with somewhat lower potency than did PMA. In intact CHO-K1 cells, I3A was able to translocate different green fluorescent protein-tagged PKC isoforms, visualized by confocal microscopy, with equal or higher potency than PMA. PKC-delta in particular showed a different pattern of translocation in response to I3A and PMA. I3A induced a higher level of secretion of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 compared with PMA in the WEHI-231 cells and displayed a marked biphasic dose-response curve for the induction. I3A was unable to cause the same extent of association of the C1b domain of PKC-delta with lipids, compared with PMA or the physiological regulator diacylglycerol, and was able to partially block the association induced by these agents, measured by surface plasmon resonance.

        "input": "PURPOSE: The fluoropyrimidine carbamate (capecitabine) is converted to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) by thymidine phosphorylase (TP) inside target tissues. 5-FU interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking thymidylate synthase (TS) but is inactivated by dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD). Favorable enzyme profiles (high TP and low DPD) generate high intratumor levels of 5-FU that are effective against many tumors, especially those with low TS. Capecitabine has not been tested against thyroid cancers, and it is not known to what extent thyroid cancers express TP, TS or DPD. METHODS: To test this, we determined TP, TS and DPD in 19 thyroid cancers from young patients (14 papillary, 4 follicular, 1 medullary) by immunohistochemistry. After approval by the Human Use Committee, the intensity of TP, TS, and DPD staining was determined by two independent examiners and graded (absent=0 to intense=3) with >90% concordance. RESULTS: TS was detected in 7/19 cancers (37%), TP in 14/19 cancers (74%) and DPD in 14/19 cancers (74%). In six tumors, TP was more intense that DPD, suggesting capecitabine sensitivity. Only five tumors failed to express TP but four of these expressed DPD, suggesting capecitabine resistance. Overall, 6/19 tumors (32% of the total) had a favorable expression profile, and all of them were papillary cancers. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the majority of differentiated thyroid cancers (74%) express TP and low levels of TS (63% undetectable). The results support the hypothesis that capecitabine is activated in the majority of differentiated thyroid cancers and that 32% have favorable expression of all three enzymes (TP, TS, and DPD).",

Enc. cuniculi, an intracellular parasite of mammalian cells, has both biosynthetic and catabolic enzymes of polyamine metabolism, as demonstrated in cell-free extracts of mature spores. The uptake of polyamines was measured in immature, pre-emergent spores isolated from host cells by Percoll gradient. Spermine was rapidly taken up and metabolized to spermidine and an unknown, possibly acetamidopropanal, by spermidine/spermine N(1)-acetyltransferase (SSAT) and polyamine oxidase (PAO). Most of the spermidine and the unknown product were found in the cell incubation medium, indicating they were released from the cell. bis(Ethyl) oligoamine analogues of polyamines, such as SL-11144 and SL-11158, as well as arylamine analogues [BW-1, a bis(phenylbenzyl) 3-7-3 analogue] blocked uptake and interconversion of spermine at micromolar levels and, in the case of BW-1, acted as substrate for PAO. The Enc. cuniculi PAO activity differed from that found in mammalian cells with respect to pH optimum, substrate specificity and sensitivity to known PAO inhibitors. SL-11158 inhibited SSAT activity with a mixed type of inhibition in which the analogue had a 70-fold higher affinity for the enzyme than the natural substrate, spermine.

The M564G mutated CrAT showed higher activity toward longer chain acyl-CoAs: activity toward myristoyl-CoA was 1250-fold higher than that of the wild-type CrAT, and lower activity toward its natural substrate, acetyl-CoA. Kinetic constants of the mutant CrAT showed modification in favor of longer acyl-CoAs as substrates. In the reverse case, mutation of the orthologous glycine (Gly553) to methionine in carnitine octanoyltransferase (COT) decreased activity toward its natural substrates, medium- and long-chain acyl-CoAs, and increased activity toward short-chain acyl-CoAs. Another CrAT mutant, M564A, was prepared and tested in the same way, with similar results. We conclude that Met564 blocks the entry of medium- and long-chain acyl-CoAs to the catalytic site of CrAT.

The rate of absorption of lumiracoxib was not significantly altered by hepatic impairment based on Cmax and Tmax. The protein-bound fraction of lumiracoxib exceeded 98% both in healthy control subjects and in those with moderate hepatic insufficiency. A single dose of 400 mg lumiracoxib was well tolerated.

The results of large clinical trials have demonstrated an overall benefit of clopidogrel over aspirin in the prevention of vascular ischemic events (myocardial infarction, stroke, vascular death) in patients with a history of symptomatic atherosclerotic disease. The antiaggregating effect of clopidogrel is attributed to an irreversible inhibition of ADP binding to a purinergic receptor present at the platelet surface. Clopidogrel is not active in vitro and can be considered a precursor of an active metabolite formed in the liver. The chemical structure of this active metabolite and its biological activity have been described recently. Several purinergic receptors have been described on platelets; P2X (1), a calcium channel, and P2Y1 a Gq-coupled seven-transmembrane domain receptor, have been found not to be antagonized by clopidogrel. Another Gi (2)-coupled receptor (named P2Y12) has been recently cloned and stably expressed in CHO cells. These cells displayed a strong affinity for (33)P-2MeS-ADP, a stable analogue of ADP, the binding characteristics of which corresponded in all points to those observed on platelets. The binding of (33)P-2MeS-ADP to these cells was strongly inhibited by the active metabolite of clopidogrel with a potency that was consistent with that observed for this compound on platelets. In these transfected CHO cells, as in platelets, ADP and 2MeS-ADP induced adenylyl cyclase downregulation, an effect that was inhibited by the active metabolite of clopidogrel. These results demonstrate that this receptor corresponds to the previously called \"P2t\" platelet receptor and show that the active metabolite of clopidogrel binds in a covalent manner to this receptor, thus explaining how it blocks the aggregating effect of ADP on platelets.",

Fifty-two anaesthetised dogs were prepared for ultrasonic measurements of external carotid blood flow.

In competition experiments with human lung glucocorticoid receptors we have determined the relative receptor affinities (RRA) of these substances with reference to dexamethasone (RRA = 100). We have discovered that 6beta-OH MF and 9,11-epoxy MF display RRAs of 206 +/- 15 and 220 +/- 22, respectively. This level of activity is similar to that of the clinically used inhaled corticosteroid flunisolide (RRA 180 +/- 11). Furthermore we observed that 9,11-epoxy MF is a chemically reactive metabolite. In recovery experiments with human plasma and lung tissue we found a time dependent decrease in extractability of the compound. Hence, we provide data that might contribute to the understanding of the pharmacokinetics as well as the clinical effects of MF.",

The phenethyl analog 1c was intermediate in inhibitory potency while inhibitors possessing a longer alkyl tether from the phenyl ring, resulted in markedly improved K(i) values. The greatest inhibitory potency was obtained for the inhibitors in which the phenyl ring was extended furthest from the central phosphorus (1f, n=5 and 1g, n=6). The slightly serrated pattern that emerged as the alkyl tether increased from three to six methylene units suggests that inhibitory potency is not simply correlated to increased hydrophobicity imparted by the phenylalkyl chain, but rather that one or more hydrophobic binding registers may exist remote from the substrate recognition architecture in the active site of PSMA.",

Subcutaneous treatment of the animals with CP-101,606 at 10 mg/kg significantly inhibited CCI-induced mechanical allodynia. Intracerebroventricular injection of CP-101,606 at 10, 30 and 100 nmol also inhibited the mechanical allodynia in a dose-dependent manner, the statistically significant effect being achieved at the highest dose tested (100 nmol) without producing any behavioral abnormalities. However, intrathecal injection of CP-101,606 at a dose of 300 nmol failed to inhibit CCI-induced allodynia. A receptor binding assay using rat forebrain and spinal cord membrane preparations demonstrated that [3H]CP-101,606 bound to the brain NR2B receptor with a greater extent compared to the spinal cord one. These findings suggest that the anti-allodynia effect of CP-101,606 is ascribable to blockade of NR2B receptors at the brain, but not at the spinal cord. In contrast, intrathecal injection of a non-selective NMDA antagonist, memantine, significantly inhibited CCI-induced mechanical allodynia at a dose of 300 nmol, indicating the difference in the site of action between the non-selective NMDA antagonist and the NR2B-specific NMDA antagonist.",

At -60 mV, succinate (4 carbons) and glutarate (5 carbons) generated inward currents due to translocation of three sodium ions and one divalent dicarboxylate, whereas oxalate (2 carbons) and malonate (3 carbons) did not. The cis-dicarboxylate maleate produced currents smaller in magnitude, whereas the trans-dicarboxylate fumarate generated currents similar to succinate. The substituted succinate derivatives, malate, 2,2- and 2,3-dimethylsuccinate, and 2,3-dimercaptosuccinate elicited inward currents, whereas aspartate and guanidinosuccinate showed hardly detectable currents. The C-5 dicarboxylates glutarate and alpha-ketoglutarate produced larger currents than succinate; glutamate and folate failed to cause inward currents. Kinetic analysis revealed, at -60 mV, K(0.5) values of 25 +/- 12 microM for succinate and 45 +/- 13 microM for alpha-ketoglutarate, values close to the plasma concentration of these compounds. For both compounds, the K(0.5) was independent of voltage, whereas the maximal current increased with hyperpolarization. As opposed to the rat and flounder orthologs, hNaDC-3 was hardly inhibited by lithium concentrations up to 5 mM. In the absence of sodium, however, lithium can mediate succinate-dependent currents.

Using whole-cell voltage clamp, we examined mibefradil block of four Na+ channel isoforms expressed in human embryonic kidney cells: Nav1.5 (cardiac), Nav1.4 (skeletal muscle), Nav1.2 (brain), and Nav1.7 (peripheral nerve). Mibefradil blocked Nav1.5 in a use/frequency-dependent manner, indicating preferential binding to states visited during depolarization. Mibefradil blocked currents of all Na+ channel isoforms with similar affinity and a dependence on holding potential, and drug off-rate was slowed at depolarized potentials (k(off) was 0.024/s at -130 mV and 0.007/s at -100 mV for Nav1.5). We further probed the interaction of mibefradil with inactivated Nav1.5 channels. Neither the degree nor the time course of block was dependent on the stimulus duration, which dramatically changed the residency time of channels in the fast-inactivated state. In addition, inhibiting the binding of the fast inactivation lid (Nav1.5 ICM + MTSET) did not alter mibefradil block, confirming that the drug does not preferentially interact with the fast-inactivated state. We also tested whether mibefradil interacted with slow-inactivated state(s). When selectively applied to channels after inducing slow inactivation with a 60-s pulse to -10 mV, mibefradil (1 microM) produced 45% fractional block in Nav1.5 and greater block (88%) in an isoform (Nav1.4) that slow-inactivates more completely.

Furthermore, the KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 channel alpha subunits are mutated in families with benign familial neonatal convulsions, a neonatal form of epilepsy. Enhancement of KCNQ2/Q3 potassium currents may provide an important target for antiepileptic drug development. Here, we show that meclofenamic acid (meclofenamate) and diclofenac, two related molecules previously used as anti-inflammatory drugs, act as novel KCNQ2/Q3 channel openers. Extracellular application of meclofenamate (EC(50) = 25 microM) and diclofenac (EC(50) = 2.6 microM) resulted in the activation of KCNQ2/Q3 K(+) currents, heterologously expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Both openers activated KCNQ2/Q3 channels by causing a hyperpolarizing shift of the voltage activation curve (-23 and -15 mV, respectively) and by markedly slowing the deactivation kinetics. The effects of the drugs were stronger on KCNQ2 than on KCNQ3 channel alpha subunits. In contrast, they did not enhance KCNQ1 K(+) currents. Both openers increased KCNQ2/Q3 current amplitude at physiologically relevant potentials and led to hyperpolarization of the resting membrane potential. In cultured cortical neurons, meclofenamate and diclofenac enhanced the M-current and reduced evoked and spontaneous action potentials, whereas in vivo diclofenac exhibited an anticonvulsant activity (ED(50) = 43 mg/kg).

The aim of this study was to determine the mechanism of pranlukast-induced interleukin-5 (IL-5) inhibition in allergic inflammation. METHODS: Surgically resected human lung tissue was passively sensitized in vitro with mite-allergen-sensitized sera, followed by stimulation with mite allergen after pretreatment of the tissue with pranlukast, dexamethasone, or both. The IL-5 protein level in the culture medium was measured, and in situ hybridization of IL-5 and CysLTR1 mRNA was performed using lung tissues. RESULTS: Pretreatment of lung tissues with pranlukast alone significantly decreased the amount of IL-5 protein in the culture medium by 40%. The combination of pranlukast and dexamethasone synergistically enhanced this effect. Quantitative in situ hybridization with image analysis revealed abundant expression of IL-5 mRNA in eosinophils, lymphocytes, and mast cells in sensitized and allergen-stimulated lung tissues. CysLTR1 mRNA was detected in macrophages, smooth muscle cells, eosinophils, and mast cells, but was less expressed in lymphocytes. Pranlukast-induced inhibition of IL-5 mRNA expression was noted in various cells, irrespective of their CysLTR1 mRNA expression status. In addition, cysteinyl leukotrienes per se failed to upregulate the IL-5 production.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Graded-intensity bicycle exercise testing was performed off drug in three patients and during oral quinidine in two patients with short QT syndrome and compared to a control group of healthy normal subjects. The in vitro effects of quinidine on currents in patch clamp technique were investigated. Off drugs QTpV3/heart rate correlation is much weaker in patients with short QT syndrome, and QTpV3 shortens less with heart rate increase compared to normal subjects. In addition to prolonging the QT interval into the normal range, quinidine restored the heart rate dependence of the QT interval toward a range of adaptation reported for normal subjects. Data from heterologous expression of wild-type and mutant HERG genes indicate the mutation causes a 20-fold increase in IC50 of d-sotalol but only a 5.8-fold increase in IC50 of quinidine. CONCLUSION: Oral quinidine is effective in suppressing the gain of function in IKr responsible for some cases of short QT syndrome with a mutation in HERG and thus restoring normal rate dependence of the QT interval and rendering ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation noninducible.",

Both truncated forms of GAD67 (tGAD67), HGAD67(Delta1-70) and HGAD67(Delta1-90), were markedly activated by ApoCaM to an extent of 141 and 85%, respectively, while GST-HGAD67 was not significantly affected. The activation appears to be due to an increase of GAD affinity for its cofactor, pyridoxal phosphate (PLP). This conclusion is based on the following observations. Firstly, the V(max) of GAD was increased when ApoCaM was present whereas the affinity for the substrate, glutamate, was not affected. Secondly, the affinity of GAD for PLP was increased in the presence of ApoCaM. Thirdly, results from calmodulin-agarose affinity column chromatography studies indicated a direct interaction or binding between ApoCaM and GAD. Fourthly, ApoCaM was found to be copurified with GAD65/GAD67 by anti-GAD65/67 immunoaffinity column using rat brain extract. Hence, it is proposed that a conformational change is induced when ApoCaM interacts with GAD65 or tGAD67, resulting in an increase of GAD affinity for PLP and the activation of GAD. The physiological significance of the interaction between GAD and ApoCaM is discussed.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: The use of beta-blockers has emerged as a beneficial treatment for congestive heart failure. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) is tightly regulated in the ventricular myocardium. However, the expression of HIF-1alpha in chronic heart failure resulting from volume overload and after treatment with beta-blocker is little known. METHODS AND RESULTS: To test the hypothesis that HIF-1alpha plays a role in the failing myocardium because of volume overload, an aorta-caval shunt was created for 4 weeks in adult Sprague-Dawley rats to induce volume-overload heart failure. Carvedilol at 50 mg/kg body weight per day after surgery was given. The heart weight and body weight ratio increased from 2.6 +/- 0.3 in the sham group to 3.9 +/- 0.7 (P < .001) in the shunt group. Left ventricular end-diastolic dimension increased from 6.5 +/- 0.5 mm to 8.7 +/- 0.6 mm (P < .001). Treatment with carvedilol in the shunt group reversed the heart weight and ventricular dimension to the baseline values. Western blot showed that HIF-1alpha, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) proteins were upregulated and nerve growth factor-beta (NGF-beta) downregulated in the shunt group. Real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that mRNA of HIF-1alpha, VEGF, and BNP increased and mRNA of NGF-beta decreased in the shunt group. Treatment with carvedilol reversed both protein and mRNA of HIF-1alpha, VEGF, BNP, and NGF-beta to the baseline values. Increased immunohistochemical labeling of HIF-1alpha, VEGF, and BNP in the ventricular myocardium was observed in the shunt group and carvedilol again normalized the labeling. CONCLUSION: HIF-1alpha and VEGF mRNA and protein expression were upregulated in the rat model of volume-overload heart failure. Treatment with carvedilol is associated with a reversal of abnormal regulation of HIF-1alpha and VEGF in the failing ventricular myocardium.",

In addition, alpha-lactalbumin (LA) enhances this Glc-T activity more than 25 times. Comparison of the crystal structures of UDP-Gal- and UDP-Glc-bound beta4Gal-T1 reveals that the O4 hydroxyl group in both Gal and Glc moieties forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain carboxylate group of Glu317. The orientation of the O4 hydroxyl of glucose causes a steric hindrance to the side chain carboxylate group of Glu317, accounting for the enzyme's low Glc-T activity. In this study, we show that mutation of Arg228, a residue in the vicinity of Glu317, to lysine (R228K-Gal-T1) results in a 15-fold higher Glc-T activity, which is further enhanced by LA to nearly 25% of the Gal-T activity of the wild type. The kinetic parameters indicate that the main effect of the mutation of Arg228 to lysine is on the k(cat) of Glc-T, which increases 3-4-fold, both in the absence and in the presence of LA; simultaneously, the k(cat) for the Gal-T reaction is reduced 30-fold. The crystal structure of R228K-Gal-T1 complexed with LA, UDP-Gal, and Mn(2+) determined at 1.9 A resolution shows that the Asp318 side chain exhibits a minor alternate conformation, compared to that in the wild type. This alternate conformation now causes a steric hindrance to the O4 hydroxyl group of the Gal moiety of UDP-Gal, probably causing the dissociation of UDP-Gal and the reduced k(cat) of the Gal-T reaction.",

We previously reported that aminoglycoside antibiotics reduce SGLT1-dependent glucose transport in pig proximal tubular epithelial LLC-PK1 cells in parallel with the order of their nephrotoxicity. In this study, using a model of gentamicin C (GMC)-induced reduction in SGLT1 activity, we examined whether ligands for megalin protect LLC-PK1 cells from the GMC-induced reduction in SGLT1 activity. We employed apolipoprotein E3 (apoE3) and lactoferrin as ligands for megalin. Then the cells were treated with various concentrations of apoE3, lactoferrin and bovine serum albumin with or without 100 microg/ml of GMC, and the SGLT1-dependent methyl alpha-D-glucopyranoside (AMG) uptake and levels of SGLT1 expression were determined. As a result, we demonstrated that the apoE3 significantly protects these cells from GMC-induced reduction in AMG uptake, but neither lactoferrin nor albumin does. In accord with a rise in AMG uptake activity, the mRNA and protein levels of SGLT1 were apparently up-regulated in the presence of apoE3. Furthermore, we found that the uptake of [3H] gentamicin is decreased by apoE3, and that apoE3 showed obvious protection against the GMC-dependent N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamidase (NAG) release from LLC-PK1 cells. Thus, these results indicate that apoE3 could be a valuable tool for the prevention of aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity.",

Cells were treated with pemetrexed and gemcitabine, and their interaction was assessed using the combination index. The role of drug metabolism in gemcitabine cytotoxicity was examined with inhibitors of deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), 5'-nucleotidase, and cytidine deaminase, whereas the role of pemetrexed targets, thymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT) in drug chemosensitivity was analyzed in cytotoxicity rescue studies. The effect of gemcitabine and pemetrexed on Akt phosphorylation was investigated with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, whereas quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to study target gene-expression profiles and its modulation by each drug. Synergistic cytotoxicity was demonstrated, and pemetrexed significantly decreased the amount of phosphorylated Akt, enhanced apoptosis, and increased the expression of dCK in A549 and Calu-6 cells, as well as the expression of the human nucleoside equilibrative transporter 1 (hENT1) in all cell lines. PCR demonstrated a correlation between dCK expression and gemcitabine sensitivity, whereas expression of TS, DHFR, and GARFT was predictive of pemetrexed chemosensitivity. These data demonstrated that 1) gemcitabine and pemetrexed synergistically interact against NSCLC cells through the suppression of Akt phosphorylation and induction of apoptosis; 2) the gene expression profile of critical genes may predict for drug chemosensitivity; and 3) pemetrexed enhances dCK and hENT1 expression, thus suggesting the role of gene-expression modulation for rational development of chemotherapy combinations.",

        "input": "Phenytoin and carbamazepine are effective and inexpensive anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs). As with many AEDs, a broad range of doses is used, with the final \"maintenance\" dose normally determined by trial and error. Although many genes could influence response to these medicines, there are obvious candidates. Both drugs target the alpha-subunit of the sodium channel, encoded by the SCN family of genes. Phenytoin is principally metabolized by CYP2C9, and both are probable substrates of the drug transporter P-glycoprotein. We therefore assessed whether variation in these genes associates with the clinical use of carbamazepine and phenytoin in cohorts of 425 and 281 patients, respectively. We report that a known functional polymorphism in CYP2C9 is highly associated with the maximum dose of phenytoin (P = 0.0066). We also show that an intronic polymorphism in the SCN1A gene shows significant association with maximum doses in regular usage of both carbamazepine and phenytoin (P = 0.0051 and P = 0.014, respectively). This polymorphism disrupts the consensus sequence of the 5' splice donor site of a highly conserved alternative exon (5N), and it significantly affects the proportions of the alternative transcripts in individuals with a history of epilepsy. These results provide evidence of a drug target polymorphism associated with the clinical use of AEDs and set the stage for a prospective evaluation of how pharmacogenetic diagnostics can be used to improve dosing decisions in the use of phenytoin and carbamazepine.

We first examined the inducing effect of myeloma cells on migration of human umbilical vein vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs). Five myeloma cell lines produced varying amounts of VEGF, and migration of HUVECs was induced by coculture with myeloma cells. We next examined the inhibitory effect of a novel synthetic retinoid Am80 (Tamibarotene) on both myeloma cells and HUVECs. Am80 is specific for the retinoic-acid receptor-alpha/beta, and has therapeutic effects in all-trans retinoic acid resistant acute promyelocytic leukemia. Am80 slightly inhibited the growth of both myeloma cells and HUVECs, and remarkably inhibited the growth of HUVECs stimulated by VEGF. Am80 showed little growth inhibition of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), but it markedly inhibited migration of HUVECs by cocultured myeloma cells. Am80 inhibited VEGF-induced phosphorylation of VEGF receptor. In addition, VEGF-induced formation of tube-like structures in vitro and neovascularization in mouse corneas were significantly inhibited by Am80. These findings clearly demonstrate that Am80 is a potential inhibitor of angiogenesis caused by the interaction between vascular endothelial cells and myeloma cells, and might be a useful therapeutic agent against MM.",

Therefore, comparative histochemical and biochemical studies of u-PA and the effects of amiloride were performed on rabbit corneas and tear fluid using the sensitive fluorogenic substrate Z-Gly-Gly-Arg-7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin. Rabbit eyes were repeatedly irradiated with UVB for 9 days and during the irradiation topically treated with amiloride (1 mg/ml saline) or placebo (saline) (dropwise, 5 times daily). Results show that in placebo-treated eyes, UVB evoked the appearance of u-PA activity in cornea and tear fluid in early stages of irradiation, and u-PA levels increased during irradiation. Corneal epithelium was gradually lost and remnants of the epithelium as well as keratocytes in the upper part of corneal stroma showed high u-PA activity. Finally, corneas lost their epithelium completely. In corneal stroma, numerous u-PA-containing inflammatory cells were present. Corneas were vascularized. When amiloride was dropped on the eye surface on the first day of irradiation and subsequently daily until the end of the experiment, u-PA activity in both cornea and tear fluid was strongly inhibited. Corneas were covered with a continuous epithelium until the end of the experiment. The number of inflammatory cells was significantly decreased. Corneal vascularization was reduced by 50%.

Human recombinant Interferon-alpha(2a) (IFNalpha(2a)) is a potent drug (Roferon-A) used to treat various cancers and viral diseases including Hepatitis B/C infections. To significantly improve the pharmacological properties of the drug, a pegylated form of IFNalpha(2a) was developed (PEGASYS). This 40 kDa PEG-conjugated IFNalpha(2a) ((40)PEG-IFNalpha(2a)) is obtained by the covalent binding of one 40 kDa branched PEG-polymer to a lysine side-chain of IFNalpha(2a). Here, we report the detailed structural, kinetic, and thermodynamic analysis of the binding to the extracellular domain of the receptor IFNAR2 of (40)PEG-IFNalpha(2a) and its isolated positional isomers modified at K31, K134, K131, K121, K164, and K70, respectively, in comparison with unmodified IFNalpha(2a). Our binding studies, using the surface plasmon resonance technique, show that the pegylation does not abolish the binding to the receptor, but significantly reduces the affinity mainly due to a change of the association rate. The results are supported by modeling and simulation of the binding, using Self-Avoiding-Walk calculations for the polymer conformations. A correlation between the structural parameters and the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of the binding of the positional isomers could be established. For the Isomer-K31 and -K164, the PEG-polymer attachment point is located in proximity to the binding interface, and the isomers display affinity in the range 150-520 nM in an enthalpy-driven binding process. In contrast for the Isomer-K134, -K131, -K121, and -K70, the PEG-polymer is attached remotely from the binding interface, and the isomers exhibit a higher affinity (32-76 nM) in an entropy-driven binding process.

In higher cortical structures such as the hippocampus, norepinephrine, via beta adrenergic receptor (AR) activation, has been shown to reinforce the cognitive processes of attention and memory. In this study, we investigated the effect of beta1AR activation on hippocampal cornu ammonis 3 (CA3) network activity. AR expression was first determined using immunocytochemistry with antibodies against beta1ARs, which were found to be exceptionally dense in hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons. CA3 network activity was then examined in vitro using field potential recordings in rat brain slices. The selective betaAR agonist isoproterenol caused an enhancement of hippocampal CA3 network activity, as measured by an increase in frequency of spontaneous burst discharges recorded in the CA3 region. In the presence of alphaAR blockade, concentration-response curves for isoproterenol, norepinephrine, and epinephrine suggested that a beta1AR was involved in this response, and the rank order of potency was isoproterenol > norepinephrine = epinephrine. Finally, equilibrium dissociation constants (pK(b)) of subtype-selective betaAR antagonists were functionally determined to characterize the AR subtype modulating hippocampal CA3 activity. The selective beta1AR antagonists atenolol and metoprolol blocked isoproterenol-induced enhancement, with apparent K(b) values of 85 +/- 36 and 3.9 +/- 1.7 nM, respectively. In contrast, the selective beta2AR antagonists ICI-118,551 and butoxamine inhibited isoproterenol-mediated enhancement with apparent low affinities (K(b) of 222 +/- 61 and 9268 +/- 512 nM, respectively).

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Diethylcarbamazine (DEC) has been used for many years in the treatment of human lymphatic filariasis. Its mode of action is not well understood, but it is known to interact with the arachidonic acid pathway. Here we have investigated the contribution of the nitric oxide and cyclooxygenase (COX) pathways to the activity of DEC against B. malayi microfilariae in mice. METHODS: B. malayi microfilariae were injected intravenously into mice and parasitaemia was measured 24 hours later. DEC was then administered to BALB/c mice with and without pre-treatment with indomethacin or dexamethasone and the parasitaemia monitored. To investigate a role for inducible nitric oxide in DEC's activity, DEC and ivermectin were administered to microfilaraemic iNOS-/- mice and their background strain (129/SV). Western blot analysis was used to determine any effect of DEC on the production of COX and inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) proteins. RESULTS: DEC administered alone to BALB/c mice resulted in a rapid and profound reduction in circulating microfilariae within five minutes of treatment. Microfilarial levels began to recover after 24 hours and returned to near pre-treatment levels two weeks later, suggesting that the sequestration of microfilariae occurs independently of parasite killing. Pre-treatment of animals with dexamethasone or indomethacin reduced DEC's efficacy by almost 90% or 56%, respectively, supporting a role for the arachidonic acid and cyclooxygenase pathways in vivo. Furthermore, experiments showed that treatment with DEC results in a reduction in the amount of COX-1 protein in peritoneal exudate cells. Additionally, in iNOS-/- mice infected with B. malayi microfilariae, DEC showed no activity, whereas the efficacy of another antifilarial drug, ivermectin, was unaffected. CONCLUSION: These results confirm the important role of the arachidonic acid metabolic pathway in DEC's mechanism of action in vivo and show that in addition to its effects on the 5-lipoxygenase pathway, it targets the cyclooxygenase pathway and COX-1. Moreover, we show for the first time that inducible nitric oxide is essential for the rapid sequestration of microfilariae by DEC.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: In long QT syndrome (LQTS), prolongation of the QT-interval is associated with sudden cardiac death resulting from potentially life-threatening polymorphic tachycardia of the torsade de pointes (TdP) type. Experimental as well as clinical reports support the hypothesis that calcium channel blockers such as verapamil may be an appropriate therapeutic approach in LQTS. We investigated the electrophysiologic mechanism by which verapamil suppresses TdP, in a recently developed intact heart model of LQT3. METHODS AND RESULTS: In 8 Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts, veratridine (0.1 microM), an inhibitor of sodium channel inactivation, led to a marked increase in QT-interval and simultaneously recorded monophasic ventricular action potentials (MAPs) (p < 0.05) thereby mimicking LQT3. In bradycardic (AV-blocked) hearts, simultaneous recording of up to eight epi- and endocardial MAPs demonstrated a significant increase in total dispersion of repolarization (56%, p < 0.05) and reverse frequency-dependence. After lowering potassium concentration, veratridine reproducibly led to early afterdepolarizations (EADs) and TdP in 6 of 8 (75%) hearts. Additional infusion of verapamil (0.75 microM) suppressed EADs and consecutively TdP in all hearts. Verapamil significantly shortened endocardial but not epicardial MAPs which resulted in significant reduction of ventricular transmural dispersion of repolarization. CONCLUSIONS: Verapamil is highly effective in preventing TdP via shortening of endocardial MAPs, reduction of left ventricular transmural dispersion of repolarization and suppression of EADs in an intact heart model of LQT3. These data suggest a possible therapeutic role of verapamil in the treatment of LQT3 patients.",

Blood vitamin A has been determined by HPLC with UV detection. Proteins have been measured by radial immunodiffusion according to Mancini. Results showed that 96 children (36.6%) presented a vitamin A deficiency (vitamin A < 200 microg/L with a retinol binding protein/transthyretin molar ratio = 0.29 +/- 0.06) while 166 (63.3%) children presented normal blood concentrations of vitamin A (vitamin A > or = 200 microg/L with a Retinol Binding Protein/Transthyretin molar ratio = 0.40 +/- 0.08). This study showed that the retinol binding protein and the immunoglobulin A are lower in children with vitamin A deficiency. On the other hand, an isolated increase of alpha-1 glycoprotein acid has been observed in boys with vitamin A deficiency. The vitamin A deficiency observed in this survey is due to a micronutrients deficiency in the diet which is essentially based on glucides. The positive correlation between vitamin A and immunoglobulin A concentrations might be the result of the vitamin A inductive effect during immunoglobulins A synthesis. The isolated increasing of alpha-1 glycoprotein acid in boys with vitamin A deficiency has been assigned to the ecosensitiveness of the unfavourable environment.

They belong to a larger family of transporters composed of 14 members in mammals based on sequence homologies. MCTs are found in various tissues including the brain where three isoforms, MCT1, MCT2 and MCT4, have been described. Each of these isoforms exhibits a distinct regional and cellular distribution in rodent brain. At the cellular level, MCT1 is expressed by endothelial cells of microvessels, by ependymocytes as well as by astrocytes. MCT4 expression appears to be specific for astrocytes. By contrast, the predominant neuronal monocarboxylate transporter is MCT2. Interestingly, part of MCT2 immunoreactivity is located at postsynaptic sites, suggesting a particular role of monocarboxylates and their transporters in synaptic transmission. In addition to variation in expression during development and upon nutritional modifications, new data indicate that MCT expression is regulated at the translational level by neurotransmitters. Understanding how transport of monocarboxylates is regulated could be of particular importance not only for neuroenergetics but also for areas such as functional brain imaging, regulation of food intake and glucose homeostasis, or for central nervous system disorders such as ischaemia and neurodegenerative diseases.",

These drugs also have vasodilatory and anti-proliferative effects on vascular smooth muscle cells. However the mechanisms for these actions are not fully understood. Adenosine is a vasodilator and a substrate of equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENT). The present study studied the effects of three thiazolidinediones, troglitazone, pioglitazone and ciglitazone, on ENT1 in the human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs). Although incubating HASMCs for 48h with thiazolidinediones had no effect on ENT1 mRNA and protein levels, troglitazone acutely inhibited [3H]adenosine uptake and [3H]NBMPR binding of HASMCs with IC50 values of 2.35+/-0.35 and 3.99+/-0.57microM, respectively. The effect of troglitazone on ENT1 was PPAR(gamma)-independent and kinetic studies revealed that troglitazone was a competitive inhibitor of ENT1. In contrast, pioglitazone and ciglitazone had minimal effects on [3H]adenosine uptake by HASMCs. Troglitazone differs from pioglitazone and ciglitazone in that its side-chain contains a Vitamin E moiety. The difference in structure of troglitazone did not account for its inhibitory effect on ENT1 because Vitamin E did not inhibit [3H]adenosine uptake by HASMCs. Using the nucleoside transporter deficient PK15NTD cells stably expressing ENT1 and ENT2, it was found that troglitazone inhibited ENT1 but had no effect on ENT2. From these results, it is suggested that troglitazone may enhance the vasodilatory effect of adenosine by inhibiting ENT1. Pharmacologically, troglitazone is a novel inhibitor of ENT1.",

However, the molecular mechanism by which thalidomide exerts its antitumor effects is poorly understood. This study was designed to clarify the relationship between antiangiogenesis and antitumor effects of thalidomide and to explore the molecular mechanism for its antitumor activity. We evaluated the effects of thalidomide on the growth of human tumor cells expressing (MCF-7 and HL-60) or not expressing (HeLa and K562) COX-2 in vitro. We also studied the effects of thalidomide on COX-1, COX-2 or bcl-2 expression, TNFalpha, VEGF, GSH and cytochrome c in these cells. Thalidomide could inhibit tumor growth in a concentration-dependent manner in MCF-7 and HL-60; its IC50s for them were 18.36+/-2.34 and 22.14+/-2.15 microM, respectively, while this effect was not observed in HeLa and K562. Thalidomide reduced COX-2 expression accompanied by a decrease of bcl-2 protein, TNFalpha, VEGF, GSH and an increased cytochrome c, but had no effect on that of COX-1, in MCF-7 and HL-60. Moreover, cells not expressing COX-2 were insensitive to the growth-inhibitory and effects on cytokines of thalidomide. In our mouse xenograft model of OVCAR-3 and HCT-8, we found that thalidomide could decrease intratumoral microvessel density in both tumors; it exerted antitumor effects only on OVCAR-3 expressing COX-2 but did not on HCT-8 not expressing COX-2. Effect of thalidomide on COX-1 and COX-2 in vivo was consistent with that of in vitro. These results demonstrated that thalidomide might inhibit growth of tumors through COX-2 degradation independent of antiangiogenesis.",

Similar to cocaine, other local anesthetics bind to the dopamine transporter (DAT) and inhibit DA uptake in rodent and monkey brain. Additionally, local anesthetics are self-administered in rhesus monkeys, indicative of abuse liability. The present study examined the reinforcing and DAT effects of the local anesthetics dimethocaine, procaine and cocaine using in vivo techniques. Monkeys were trained to respond under a second-order schedule for i.v. cocaine administration (0.10 or 0.30 mg/kg/infusion). When responding was stable, dimethocaine (0.030-1.7 mg/kg/ infusion) or procaine (0.10-10 mg/kg/ infusion) was substituted for the cocaine training dose. Dimethocaine administration produced higher response rates compared with that of procaine, and was a more potent reinforcer. Drug effects on behavior were related to DAT occupancy in monkey striatum during neuroimaging with positron emission tomography (PET). DAT occupancy was determined by displacement of 8-(2-[(18)F]fluroethyl)2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-chlorophenyl)nortropane (FECNT). DAT occupancy was between 66 and 82% and <10-41% for doses of dimethocaine and procaine that maintained maximum response rates, respectively. Finally, in vivo microdialysis in awake subjects determined drug-induced changes in extracellular DA in the caudate nucleus. There was close correspondence between peak increases in DA and DAT occupancy. Overall, reinforcing effects were consistent with DAT effects determined with in vivo techniques. The results further support a role for the DAT in the abuse liability of local anesthetics.",

This undesirable long QT side effect has been a major reason for the withdrawal of medications from the pharmaceutical market. Understanding the molecular basis of hERG block is therefore essential to facilitate the design of safe drugs. Binding sites for hERG blockers have been mapped within the inner cavity of the channel and include aromatic residues in the S6 helix (Tyr-652, Phe-656) and residues in the pore helix (Thr-623, Ser-624, Val-625). We used mutagenesis of these residues, combined with an investigation of hERG block by close analogs of clofilium and ibutilide, to assess how specific alterations in drug structure affected potency and binding interactions. Although changing the basic nitrogen from quaternary to tertiary accelerated the onset of block, the IC(50) and kinetics for recovery from block were similar. In contrast, analogs with different para-substituents on the phenyl ring had significantly different potencies for wild-type hERG block. The highest potency was achieved with polar or electronegative para-substituents, whereas neutral para-substituents had potencies more than 100-fold lower. Results from mutagenesis and molecular modeling studies suggest that phenyl ring para-substituents influence drug interactions with Thr-623, Ser-624, and Tyr-652 and strongly affect binding affinity. Together, these findings suggest that modifying the para-substituent could be a useful strategy for reducing hERG potency and increasing the safety margin of compounds in development.",

However, exactly how tPA transduces its signal into the nucleus to control gene expression is unknown. This study investigated the mechanism by which tPA induces MMP-9 gene expression. Both wild-type and non-enzymatic mutant tPA were found to induce MMP-9 expression in rat kidney interstitial fibroblasts (NRK-49F), indicating that the actions of tPA are independent of its proteolytic activity. tPA bound to the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP-1) in NRK-49F cells, and this binding was competitively abrogated by the LRP-1 antagonist, the receptor-associated protein. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts (PEA-13) lacking LRP-1, tPA failed to induce MMP-9 expression. Furthermore, tPA induced rapid tyrosine phosphorylation on the beta subunit of LRP-1, which was followed by the activation of Mek1 and its downstream Erk-1 and -2. Blockade of Erk-1/2 activation by the Mek1 inhibitor abolished MMP-9 induction by tPA in NRK-49F cells. Conversely, overexpression of constitutively activated Mek1 induced Erk-1/2 phosphorylation and MMP-9 expression. In mouse obstructed kidney, tPA, LRP-1, and MMP-9 were concomitantly induced in the renal interstitium. Collectively, these results suggest that besides its classical proteolytic activity, tPA acts as a cytokine that binds to the cell membrane receptor LRP-1, induces its tyrosine phosphorylation, and triggers intracellular signal transduction, thereby inducing specific gene expression in renal interstitial fibroblasts.",

The firefly-luciferase (FL) gene, fused with various lengths of the 5'-flanking region of the L-PK gene, was introduced into mouse liver by HT. The mice had free access to a high-carbohydrate diet. In liver homogenate, luciferase activity of pL-PK(-1467)-FL (which included the 5'-flanking region from bp -1467 to +17), was markedly stimulated by feeding. 5'-Deletion up to bp -1065 caused only minor changes in luciferase activity, but further deletion up to bp -690 and bp -203 caused significant, gradual decreases in activity. Further analyses utilizing 5'-deletion mutants indicated the existence of positive regulatory regions that respond to stimulation by feeding between bp -1065 and -945, and between -300 and -203 on the L-PK gene.

In humans and mice, two GSTO genes have been recognized and their genetic structures and expression patterns identified. In both species, GSTO1 mRNA is expressed in liver and heart as well as a range of other tissues. GSTO2 is expressed predominantly in the testis, although moderate levels of expression are seen in other tissues. Extensive immunohistochemistry of rat and human tissue sections has demonstrated cellular and subcellular specificity in the expression of GSTO1-1. The crystal structure of recombinant human GSTO1-1 has been determined, and it adopts the canonical GST fold. A cysteine residue in place of the catalytic tyrosine or serine residues found in other GSTs was shown to form a mixed disulfide with glutathione. Omega class GSTs have dehydroascorbate reductase and thioltransferase activities and also catalyze the reduction of monomethylarsonate, an intermediate in the pathway of arsenic biotransformation. Other diverse actions of human GSTO1-1 include modulation of ryanodine receptors and interaction with cytokine release inhibitory drugs. In addition, GSTO1 has been linked to the age at onset of both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Several polymorphisms have been identified in the coding regions of the human GSTO1 and GSTO2 genes. Our laboratory has expressed recombinant human GSTO1-1 and GSTO2-2 proteins, as well as a number of polymorphic variants. The expression and purification of these proteins and determination of their enzymatic activity is described.",

These changes include increased activity of several components of the cAMP signaling pathway that are thought to be associated with psychological and somatic signs of opiate withdrawal. The neuropeptide galanin has been shown to attenuate cAMP signaling in multiple cell types. The current study demonstrates that acute galanin treatment blocks the consequences of increased cAMP signaling following chronic opiate administration and withdrawal in Cath.a cells and primary cultures of striatal neurons as measured by phosphorylation of the transcription factor cAMP regulatory element-binding protein (CREB). In addition, galanin-mediated attenuation of CREB phosphorylation is independent of galanin-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 phosphorylation in Cath.a cells. These data suggest that galanin receptors may serve as an additional potential therapeutic target for the treatment of opiate withdrawal.",

Two beta(2)-agonists, formoterol and salmeterol, are approved for treating asthma and have an extended duration of action and increased safety, associated with greater beta(2)-adrenoceptor selectivity. The pharmacological profiles of formoterol and salmeterol and their effects on skeletal and cardiac muscle mass were investigated in 12-week-old, male F344 rats. Formoterol and salmeterol were each administered via daily i.p. injection at one of seven doses (ranging from 1 to 2,000 microg kg(-1) day(-1)), for 4 weeks. Rats were anaesthetised and the EDL and soleus muscles and the heart were excised and weighed. Dose-response curves were constructed based on skeletal and cardiac muscle hypertrophy. Formoterol was more potent than salmeterol, with a significantly lower ED(50) in EDL muscles (1 and 130 microg kg(-1) day(-1), P <0.05), whereas salmeterol had greater intrinsic activity than formoterol in both EDL and soleus muscles (12% greater hypertrophy than formoterol). The drugs had similar potency and intrinsic activity in the heart, with a smaller leftward shift for formoterol than seen in skeletal muscle. A dose of 25 microg kg(-1) day(-1) of formoterol elicited greater EDL and soleus hypertrophy than salmeterol, but resulted in similar beta-adrenoceptor downregulation.

This mutation is inherently resistant to imatinib and, to date, there remains no effective curative therapy for systemic mastocytosis associated with KITD816V. Dasatinib (BMS-354825) is a novel orally bioavailable SRC/ABL inhibitor that has activity against multiple imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL isoforms in vitro that is presently showing considerable promise in early-phase clinical trials of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Pharmacokinetic analysis suggests that high nanomolar concentrations of dasatinib can be achieved safely in humans. In this study, we demonstrate significant inhibitory activity of dasatinib against both wild-type KIT and the KITD816V mutation in the nanomolar range in in vitro and cell-based kinase assays. Additionally, dasatinib leads to growth inhibition of a KITD816V-harboring human masto-cytosis cell line. Significantly, dasatinib selectively kills primary neoplastic bone marrow mast cells from patients with systemic mastocytosis while sparing other hematopoietic cells. Computer modeling suggests that the KITD816V mutation destabilizes the inactive conformation of the KIT activation loop to which imatinib binds, but it is not predicted to impair binding of KIT by dasatinib. Based upon our results, further evaluation of dasatinib for the treatment of systemic masto-cytosis in clinical trials is warranted.

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Since the introduction of the first cholinesterase inhibitor (ChEI) in 1997, most clinicians and probably most patients would consider the cholinergic drugs, donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine, to be the first line pharmacotherapy for mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.The drugs have slightly different pharmacological properties, but they all work by inhibiting the breakdown of acetylcholine, an important neurotransmitter associated with memory, by blocking the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. The most that these drugs could achieve is to modify the manifestations of Alzheimer's disease. Cochrane reviews of each ChEI for Alzheimer's disease have been completed (Birks 2005, Birks 2005b and Loy 2005). Despite the evidence from the clinical studies and the intervening clinical experience the debate on whether ChEIs are effective continues. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine in people with mild, moderate or severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. SEARCH STRATEGY: The Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register was searched using the terms 'donepezil', 'E2020' , 'Aricept' , galanthamin* galantamin* reminyl, rivastigmine, exelon, \"ENA 713\" and ENA-713 on 12 June 2005. This Register contains up-to-date records of all major health care databases and many ongoing trial databases. SELECTION CRITERIA: All unconfounded, blinded, randomized trials in which treatment with a ChEI was compared with placebo or another ChEI for patients with mild, moderate or severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted by one reviewer (JSB), pooled where appropriate and possible, and the pooled treatment effects, or the risks and benefits of treatment estimated. MAIN RESULTS: The results of 13 randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trials demonstrate that treatment for periods of 6 months and one year, with donepezil, galantamine or rivastigmine at the recommended dose for people with mild, moderate or severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease produced improvements in cognitive function, on average -2.7 points (95%CI -3.0 to -2.3), in the midrange of the 70 point ADAS-Cog Scale. Study clinicians blind to other measures rated global clinical state more positively in treated patients. Benefits of treatment were also seen on measures of activities of daily living and behaviour. None of these treatment effects are large. There is nothing to suggest the effects are less for patients with severe dementia or mild dementia, although there is very little evidence for other than mild to moderate dementia.More patients leave ChEI treatment groups, approximately 29 %, on account of adverse events than leave the placebo groups (18%). There is evidence of more adverse events in total in the patients treated with a ChEI than with placebo. Although many types of adverse event were reported, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, were significantly more frequent in the ChEI groups than in placebo. There are four studies, all supported by one of the pharmaceutical companies, in which two ChEIs were compared, two studies of donepezil compared with galantamine, and two of donepezil compared with rivastigmine. In three studies the patients were not blinded to treatment, only the fourth, DON vs RIV/Bullock is double blind. Two of the studies provide little evidence, they are of 12 weeks duration, which is barely long enough to complete the drug titration. There is no evidence from DON vs GAL/Wilcock of a treatment difference between donepezil and galantamine at 52 weeks for cognition, activities of daily living, the numbers who leave the trial before the end of treatment, the number who suffer any adverse event, or any specific adverse event. There is no evidence from DON vs RIV/Bullock of a difference between donepezil and rivastigmine for cognitive function, activities of daily living and behavioural disturbance at two years. Fewer patients suffer adverse events on donepezil than rivastigmine. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The three cholinesterase inhibitors are efficacious for mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. It is not possible to identify those who will respond to treatment prior to treatment. There is no evidence that treatment with a ChEI is not cost effective. Despite the slight variations in the mode of action of the three cholinesterase inhibitors there is no evidence of any differences between them with respect to efficacy. There appears to be less adverse effects associated with donepezil compared with rivastigmine. It may be that galantamine and rivastigmine match donepezil in tolerability if a careful and gradual titration routine over more than three months is used. Titration with donepezil is more straightforward and the lower dose may be worth consideration.",

Increased intracellular polyamine levels accompany several types of cancers as well as other human diseases, and compounds that affect the expression, activity, or stability of SSAT are being explored as potential therapeutic drugs. We have expressed human SSAT from the cloned cDNA in Escherichia coli and have determined high-resolution structures of wild-type and mutant SSAT, as the free dimer and in binary and ternary complexes with CoA, acetyl-CoA (AcCoA), spermine, and the inhibitor N1,N11bis-(ethyl)-norspermine (BE-3-3-3). These structures show details of binding sites for cofactor, substrates, and inhibitor and provide a framework to understand enzymatic activity, mutations, and the action of potential drugs. Two dimer conformations were observed: a symmetric form with two open surface channels capable of binding substrate or cofactor, and an asymmetric form in which only one of the surface channels appears capable of binding and acetylating polyamines. SSAT was found to self-acetylate lysine-26 in the presence of AcCoA and absence of substrate, a reaction apparently catalzyed by AcCoA bound in the second channel of the asymmetric dimer. These unexpected and intriguing complexities seem likely to have some as yet undefined role in regulating SSAT activity or stability as a part of polyamine homeostasis. Sequence signatures group SSAT with proteins that appear to have thialysine Nepsilon-acetyltransferase activity.",

        "input": "IL-2 is a cytokine that functions as a growth factor and central regulator in the immune system and mediates its effects through ligand-induced hetero-trimerization of the receptor subunits IL-2R alpha, IL-2R beta, and gamma(c). Here, we describe the crystal structure of the trimeric assembly of the human IL-2 receptor ectodomains in complex with IL-2 at 3.0 A resolution. The quaternary structure is consistent with a stepwise assembly from IL-2/IL-2R alpha to IL-2/IL-2R alpha/IL-2R beta to IL-2/IL-2R alpha/IL-2R beta/gamma(c). The IL-2R alpha subunit forms the largest of the three IL-2/IL-2R interfaces, which, together with the high abundance of charge-charge interactions, correlates well with the rapid association rate and high-affinity interaction of IL-2R alpha with IL-2 at the cell surface. Surprisingly, IL-2R alpha makes no contacts with IL-2R beta or gamma(c), and only minor changes are observed in the IL-2 structure in response to receptor binding. These findings support the principal role of IL-2R alpha to deliver IL-2 to the signaling complex and act as regulator of signal transduction. Cooperativity in assembly of the final quaternary complex is easily explained by the extraordinarily extensive set of interfaces found within the fully assembled IL-2 signaling complex, which nearly span the entire length of the IL-2R beta and gamma(c) subunits. Helix A of IL-2 wedges tightly between IL-2R beta and gamma(c) to form a three-way junction that coalesces into a composite binding site for the final gamma(c) recruitment. The IL-2/gamma(c) interface itself exhibits the smallest buried surface and the fewest hydrogen bonds in the complex, which is consistent with its promiscuous use in other cytokine receptor complexes.",

The clinical importance of such interactions includes autoinduction leading to suboptimal or failed treatment. The concomitantly administered effects of rifampicin on other drugs can result in their altered metabolism or transportation that are metabolised by cytochromes P450 or transported by p-glycoprotein in the gastrointestinal tract and liver. This review paper summarises recent findings with emphases on the molecular mechanisms used to explain these broad drug-drug interactions. In general, rifampicin can act on a pattern: rifampicin activates the nuclear pregnane X receptor that in turn affects cytochromes P450, glucuronosyltransferases and p-glycoprotein activities. This pattern of action may explain many of the rifampicin inducing drug-drug interactions. However, effects through other mechanisms have also been reported and these make any explanation of such drug-drug interactions more complex.",

        "input": "Excess activation of glutamatergic neurotransmission in the cerebral cortex following ethanol withdrawal is considered to contribute to significant behavioural disturbances, and to alcohol craving. Astrocytes may play a role in these manifestations because astrocytes are essential in the regulation of released glutamate and its conversion to glutamine through the enzyme glutamine synthetase (GS). However, it is unclear if withdrawal from free-choice ethanol drinking causes changes in the numbers of astrocytes expressing GS or the cytoskeletal protein of astrocytes glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Alcohol-preferring (P) rats exposed to free-choice ethanol drinking were either maintained without forced interruption of ethanol drinking, subjected to a 3-day withdrawal period at the end of 2 months, or subjected to three 3-day withdrawal periods along 6 months. At 2 months, P rats were also compared with alcohol-naive alcohol non-preferring rats (NP) rats. Packing density of GS and GFAP-immunoreactive (IR) astrocytes was measured in sections from the prelimbic cortex (PLC) using the optical disector probe. An alcohol deprivation effect was observed in P rats with withdrawals during a 6-month ethanol drinking period. Ethanol withdrawal significantly increased the packing density of GS- and GFAP-IR astrocytes in the PLC of P rats as compared with P rats with continuous access to ethanol. In addition, there was a positive correlation between the pre-withdrawal ethanol consumption and the packing density of GS-IR astrocytes. The present results suggest the involvement of astrocytes in the regulation of the glutamatergic activation associated with withdrawal from free-choice ethanol consumption and point to differential adaptations of GS and GFAP to prolonged alcohol drinking in the PLC of P rats.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: There have been many studies of the effect of high-dose supplementation of vitamin B6 on children and adults with autism, with all but one reporting benefits. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the biochemical basis for vitamin B6 therapy by measuring the level of total vitamin B6 in the plasma of unsupplemented children with autism spectrum disorder compared to unsupplemented control subjects. PARTICIPANTS: Children with autism spectrum disorders (n = 35, age 3-9 years) and unrelated typical children (n = 11, age 6-9 years), all from Arizona, were studied. (This includes the data from 24 children with autism from our previous study.) METHODOLOGY: A microbiologic assay was used to measure the level of total vitamin B6 (including phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms), in a blinded fashion. RESULTS: Children with autism had a 75% higher level of total vitamin B6 than the controls (medians of 56 versus 32 ng/mL, respectively, p = 0.00002). Most of the autistic children (77%) had levels that were more than 2 standard deviations above the median value of the controls. The autistic girls (n = 5) also had elevated levels (mean of 54.6 ng/mL, median of 60 ng/mL). DISCUSSION: These results are consistent with previous studies that found that: (1) pyridoxal kinase had a very low activity in children with autism and (2) pyridoxal 5 phosphate (PLP) levels are unusually low in children with autism. Thus, it appears that the low conversion of pyridoxal and pyridoxine to PLP results in low levels of PLP, which is the active cofactor for 113 known enzymatic reactions, including the formation of many key neurotransmitters. CONCLUSIONS: Total vitamin B6 is abnormally high in autism, consistent with previous reports of an impaired pyridoxal kinase for the conversion of pyridoxine and pyridoxal to PLP. This may explain the many published studies of benefits of high-dose vitamin B6 supplementation in some children and adults with autism.",

Both pharmacologic inhibitors target several tyrosine kinases, including Bcr-Abl and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR). Up to this point, the PDGFR has not been a primary therapeutic target for this class of agents. The work of Chen and colleagues shows that dasatinib is a particularly potent inhibitor of PDGFR and that the compound also targets Src kinase.

Sulindac metabolites simultaneously (a) increase cellular cyclic GMP and subsequently activate cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG); (b) activate c-jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK); (c) inhibit extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2); and (d) decrease beta-catenin protein expression at times and doses consistent with apoptosis. The purpose of this study was to determine if PKG, ERK1/2, JNK, and beta-catenin are independent targets for sulindac in vitro. Pharmacologic activation of PKG with YC-1 increases JNK phosphorylation and induces apoptosis in colon cancer cells without modulating ERK1/2 phosphorylation or beta-catenin protein expression. Inhibition of ERK1/2 with U0126 induces apoptosis but fails to activate JNK phosphorylation or down-regulate beta-catenin protein expression. Cotreatment with U0126 and YC-1 synergistically increases apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells and recapitulates the effects of sulindac treatment on ERK1/2, JNK, and beta-catenin. These results indicate that sulindac metabolites modulate ERK1/2 and PKG pathways independently in colon cancer cells and suggest that the full apoptotic effect of sulindac is mediated by more than one pathway. Using similar combinatorial approaches in vivo may provide more effective, less toxic chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic strategies. Such therapies could dramatically reduce the incidence and death rate from colorectal cancer.",

In contrast, nanoparticles linked to apolipoprotein E variants that do not recognize lipoprotein receptors failed to induce these effects.

        "input": "One of the main theories concerning the mechanism of action of antidepressant drugs (ADs) is based on the notion that the neurochemical background of depression involves an impairment of central noradrenergic transmission with a concomitant decrease of the norepinephrine (NE) in the synaptic gap. Many ADs increase synaptic NE availability by inhibition of the reuptake of NE. Using mice lacking NE transporter (NET-/-) we examined their baseline phenotype as well as the response in the forced swim test (FST) and in the tail suspension test (TST) upon treatment with ADs that display different pharmacological profiles. In both tests, the NET-/- mice behaved like wild-type (WT) mice acutely treated with ADs. Autoradiographic studies showed decreased binding of the beta-adrenergic ligand [3H]CGP12177 in the cerebral cortex of NET-/- mice, indicating the changes at the level of beta-adrenergic receptors similar to those obtained with ADs treatment. The binding of [3H]prazosin to alpha1-adrenergic receptors in the cerebral cortex of NET-/- mice was also decreased, most probably as an adaptive response to the sustained elevation of extracellular NE levels observed in these mice. A pronounced NET knockout-induced shortening of the immobility time in the TST (by ca 50%) compared to WT mice was not reduced any further by NET-inhibiting ADs such as reboxetine, desipramine, and imipramine. Citalopram, which is devoid of affinity for the NET, exerted a significant reduction of immobility time in the NET-/- mice. In the FST, reboxetine, desipramine, imipramine, and citalopram administered acutely did not reduce any further the immobility time shortened by NET knockout itself (ca 25%); however, antidepressant-like action of repeatedly (7 days) administered desipramine was observed in NET-/- mice, indicating that the chronic presence of this drug may also affect other neurochemical targets involved in the behavioral reactions monitored by this test. From the present study, it may be concluded that mice lacking the NET may represent a good model of some aspects of depression-resistant behavior, paralleled with alterations in the expression of adrenergic receptors, which result as an adaptation to elevated levels of extracellular NE.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Motor vehicle accidents (MVAs) are a leading cause of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the general population. Alterations in norepinephrine and serotonin systems have been proposed as mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of the condition, with treatment directed at these neurotransmitter systems. Reboxetine, a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, exhibits high affinity and selectivity for the human norepinephrine transporter. Inasmuch as PTSD may be associated with dysregulation of noradrenergic activity, the present double-blind randomized clinical trial intended to evaluate reboxetine's efficacy in the management of MVA-related PTSD and to compare its efficacy with a medication commonly used in PTSD, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluvoxamine. METHODS: Forty patients with MVA-related PTSD attending a local community mental health outpatient clinic were randomized to receive a fixed dose of either reboxetine (8 mg/d) or fluvoxamine (150 mg/d) in a double-blind fashion for a period of 8 weeks. RESULTS: At baseline and at study end point, the 2 subgroups demonstrated no statistical differences in scores on PTSD, depression, and anxiety rating scales. Both medications led to significant improvements in all clinical scales measured. Nine patients receiving reboxetine and 3 receiving fluvoxamine withdrew from the study because of side effects. CONCLUSIONS: Study observations indicate comparable efficacy of reboxetine and fluvoxamine in the management of MVA-related PTSD despite reboxetine's selective noradrenergic activity. Reboxetine appears to be at least as effective as fluvoxamine and may offer an alternative management option in this often difficult-to-treat and disabling condition. A lower and flexible reboxetine dosing schedule will be recommended for future research to improve its tolerability in PTSD patients.",

        "input": "Evidence has accumulated in the last few years that the expression of the microsomal/peroxidase antigen (M/TPO-Ag) in thyroid cells is induced by TSH, through pathways which involve intracellular cAMP accumulation and protein synthesis. These data have been found true in any thyroid system studied so far, both in terms of immunologic and enzymatic activity of TPO. TSH and cAMP also increase the levels of the specific mRNA for TPO in thyroid cells from different species. Whether this phenomenon is due to a direct transcriptional regulation of the TPO gene, as shown in dog thyroid cells, or to posttranscriptional effects, as it would appear in FRTL-5 cells, remains to be clarified by future experiments. Thyroid stimulating antibody (TSAb) of Graves' disease also stimulates the expression of M/TPO-Ag. This finding gives further support to the relevance of TSAb in the pathogenesis of hyperthyroidism and explains the well known observation that the \"microsomal\" antigen is particularly abundant in glands of Graves' patients. The modulation of M/TPO-Ag surface expression by TSH can explain the decrease of circulating anti-MAb observed during L-thyroxine therapy in hypothyroid patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Other agents, such as methimazole and sodium iodide, which influence thyroid cell function, do not directly interfere with the expression of M/TPO-Ag. Cytokines, such as gamma-interferon, interleukin-1, and interleukin-6 have been shown to inhibit the TSH-induced increase of TPO mRNA, but further investigations are required to elucidate the exact role of cytokines in the regulation of M/TPO-Ag expression.",

Rats were fed experimental diets containing SPI or casein as a nitrogen source. SPI feeding decreased the hepatic contents of total ACC mRNA as well as triglyceride (TG) content, but dietary SPI affected the amount of sterol-regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)-1 mRNA and protein very little. The amount of ACC mRNA transcribed from PII promoter containing SRE was not significantly affected by dietary protein, while a significant decrease in PI-generated ACC mRNA content was observed in rats fed the SPI diet.

Recently, the role of nonequilibrium components in controlling cardiac action potential plateau duration, and their importance in regulating the occurrence of afterdepolarizations and arrhythmias have garnered more attention. In particular, late Na current (late I(Na)) has been shown to be important in LQT2 and LQT3 arrhythmias. Class III agents like dofetilide, clofilium, and sotalol, which can all cause a drug-induced form of LQT2, significantly lengthen action potential duration at 50% and 90% repolarization in isolated rabbit Purkinje fibers, and can initiate the formation of early afterdepolarizations, and extra beats. These actions can lead to the development of a serious ventricular tachycardia, torsades de pointes, in animal models and patients. However, pretreatment with agents that block late I(Na), like lidocaine, mexiletine, and RSD1235, a novel mixed ion channel blocker for the rapid pharmacologic conversion of atrial fibrillation, significantly attenuates the prolonging effects of Class III agents or those induced by ATX-II, a specific toxin that delays Na channel inactivation and amplifies late I(Na) greatly, mimicking LQT3. The Na channel block caused by lidocaine and RSD1235 can be through the open or inactivated states of the channel, but both equivalently inhibit a late component of Na current (I(Na)), recorded at 22 degrees C using whole-cell patch clamp of Nav 1.5 expressed in HEK cells. These protective actions of lidocaine, mexiletine, and RSD1235 may result, at least in part, from their ability to inhibit late I(Na) during action potential repolarization, and inhibition of the inward currents contributing to EAD and arrhythmia formation.",

However, they lack the N-terminal and the Zn-cysteine motif participating to the stability of an active dimer in the mammalian isoforms. The unique properties of HNS make it an excellent model system for probing how the heme environment tunes NO dynamics and for comparing it to the endothelial NO synthase heme domain (eNOS(HD)) using ultrafast transient spectroscopy. NO rebinding in HNS from Staphylococcus aureus (SA-HNS) is faster than that measured for either Bacillus anthracis (BA-HNS) or for eNOS(HD) in both oxidized and reduced forms in the presence of arginine. To test whether these distinct rates arise from different energy barriers for NO recombination, we measured rebinding kinetics at several temperatures. Our data are consistent with different barriers for NO recombination in SA-HNS and BA-HNS and the presence of a second NO-binding site. The hypothesis that an additional NO-binding cavity is present in BA-HNS is also consistent with the effect of the NO concentration on its rebinding. The lack of the effect of NO concentration on the geminate rebinding in SA-HNS could be due to an isolated second site. We confirm the existence of a second NO site in the oxygenase domain of the reduced eNOS as previously hypothesized [A. Slama-Schwok, M. Negrerie, V. Berka, J.C. Lambry, A.L. Tsai, M.H. Vos, J.L.

In addition, several receptor tyrosine kinases, acting upstream of Ras, were found either mutated or overexpressed in human tumors. Because oncogenic activation of the Ras/RAF pathway may lead to a sustained proliferative signal resulting in tumor growth and progression, inhibition of this pathway represents an attractive approach for cancer drug discovery. A novel class of biaryl urea that inhibits C-RAF kinase was discovered using a combination of medicinal and combinatorial chemistry approaches. This effort culminated in the identification of the clinical candidate BAY 43-9006 (Sorafenib, Nexavar), which has recently been approved by the FDA for advanced renal cell carcinoma in phase III clinical trials. Sorafenib inhibited the kinase activity of both C-RAF and B-RAF (wild type and V600E mutant). It inhibited MEK and ERK phosphorylation in various cancer cell lines and tumor xenografts and exhibited potent oral antitumor activity in a broad spectrum of human tumor xenograft models. Further characterization of sorafenib revealed that this molecule was a multikinase inhibitor that targeted the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor family (VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor family (PDGFR-beta and Kit), which play key roles in tumor progression and angiogenesis. Thus, sorafenib may inhibit tumor growth by a dual mechanism, acting either directly on the tumor (through inhibition of Raf and Kit signaling) and/or on tumor angiogenesis (through inhibition of VEGFR and PDGFR signaling). In phase I and phase II clinical trials, sorafenib showed limited side effects and, more importantly, disease stabilization.

In the present study, we have evaluated possible participation of monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) responsible for the bidirectional membrane transport of pyruvate in the cytoprotective property in osteoblasts. Expression of the MCT2 isoform was found in cultured rat calvarial osteoblasts and in osteoblasts located on mouse tibia at both mRNA and protein levels. The accumulation of [14C]pyruvate occurred in a temperature- and pH-dependent manner in osteoblasts cultured for 7 days with high sensitivity to a specific MCT inhibitor, whereas pyruvate was released into extracellular spaces from cultured osteoblasts in a fashion sensitive to the MCT inhibitor. Transient overexpression of the MCT2 isoform led to reduced vulnerability to the cytotoxicity of hydrogen peroxide with an increased activity of [14C]pyruvate accumulation in murine osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells. Ovariectomy significantly decreased the content of pyruvate in femoral bone marrows in mice in vivo, whereas daily i.p. administration of pyruvate at 0.25 g/kg significantly prevented alterations of several histomorphometric parameters as well as cancellous bone loss in femurs by ovariectomy on 28 days after the operation.

However, the complex fails to stimulate splicing activity. The x-ray co-crystal structure of LeuRS showed that a C-terminal extension of about 60 amino acids forms a discrete domain, which is unique among the LeuRSs and interacts with the corner of the L-shaped tRNALeu. Interestingly, deletion of the entire yeast mitochondrial LeuRS C-terminal domain enhanced its aminoacylation and amino acid editing activities. In striking contrast, deletion of the corresponding C-terminal domain of Escherichia coli LeuRS abolished aminoacylation of tRNALeu and also amino acid editing of mischarged tRNA molecules. These results suggest that the role of the leucine-specific C-terminal domain in tRNA recognition for aminoacylation and amino acid editing has adapted differentially and with surprisingly opposite effects. We propose that the secondary role of yeast mitochondrial LeuRS in RNA splicing has impacted the functional evolution of this critical C-terminal domain.",

To determine whether arginases modulate the endothelial NO synthesis, we investigated the effects of the competitive arginase inhibitor N(omega)-hydroxy-nor-L-arginine (Nor-NOHA) on the activity of NOS, arginases, and L-arginine transporter and on NO release at surface of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). In unstimulated cells, Nor-NOHA dose-dependently reduced the arginase activity with maximal inhibition at 20 microM. When HUVECs were stimulated by thrombin without extracellular L-arginine, Nor-NOHA dose-dependently increased the NOS activity and the NO release with maximal effects at 20 microM. Extracellular L-arginine also dose-dependently increased NO release and arginase activity. When HUVECs were stimulated by thrombin in the presence of 100 microM L-arginine, NOS activity and NO release were similar in untreated and Nor-NOHA-treated cells. However, despite activation of L-arginine uptake, the inhibition of arginase activity by Nor-NOHA was still significant. The depletion of freely exchangeable L-arginine pools with extracellular L-lysine did not prevent Nor-NOHA from increasing the NO release. This indicates the presence of pools, which are accessible to NOS and arginase, but not exchangeable. Interestingly, the mitochondrial arginase II was constitutively expressed, whereas the cytosolic arginase I was barely detectable in HUVECs. These data suggest that endothelial NO synthesis depends on the activity of arginase II in mitochondria and l-arginine carriers in cell membrane.",

Since voltage-dependent Ca2+ currents play a key role in insulin secretion, we examined whether adrenaline modulates voltage-dependent Ca2+ currents of the rat insulinoma cell line, RINm5F. In the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique, dihydropyridine- but not omega-conotoxin-sensitive Ca2+ currents were identified. Adrenaline via alpha 2-adrenoceptors inhibited the Ca2+ currents by about 50%. Somatostatin which also inhibits insulin secretion was less efficient (inhibition by 20%). The hormonal inhibition of Ca2+ currents was not affected by intracellularly applied cAMP but blocked by the intracellularly applied GDP analog guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) and by pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin. In contrast to adrenaline and somatostatin, galanin, another inhibitor of insulin secretion, reduced Ca2+ currents by about 40% in a pertussis toxin-insensitive manner. Immunoblot experiments performed with antibodies generated against synthetic peptides revealed that membranes of RINm5F cells possess four pertussis toxin-sensitive G-proteins including Gi1, Gi2, Go2, and another Go subtype, most likely representing Go1. In membranes of control but not of pertussis toxin-treated cells, adrenaline via alpha 2-adrenoceptors stimulated incorporation of the photo-reactive GTP analog [alpha-32P]GTP azidoanilide into pertussis toxin substrates comigrating with the alpha-subunits of Gi2, Go2, and the not further identified Go subtype. The present findings indicate that activated alpha 2-adrenoceptors of RINm5F cells interact with multiple G-proteins, i.e. two forms of Go and with Gi2. These G-proteins are likely to be involved in the adrenaline-induced inhibition of dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ currents and in other signal transduction pathways contributing to the adrenaline-induced inhibition of insulin secretion.",

ANXA1 was detected by Western blot analysis in wild-type tissue and localized predominantly to the stromal-vascular compartment. Epididymal fat pad mass was reduced by ANXA1 gene deletion, but adipocyte size was unchanged, suggesting that ANXA1 is required for the maintenance of adipocyte and/or preadipocyte cell number. Epididymal tissue from wild-type mice responded in vitro to noradrenaline and isoprenaline with increased glycerol release, reduced IL-6 release, and increased cAMP accumulation. Qualitatively similar but significantly attenuated responses to the catecholamines were observed in tissue from ANXA1-null mice, an effect that was not associated with changes in beta-adrenoceptor mRNA expression. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) also stimulated lipolysis in vitro, but its effects were muted by ANXA1 gene deletion. By contrast, LPS failed to influence IL-6 release from wild-type tissue but stimulated the release of the cytokine from tissue from ANXA1-null mice. ANXA1 gene deletion did not affect glucocorticoid receptor expression or the ability of dexamethasone to suppress catecholamine-induced lipolysis. It did, however, augment IL-6 expression and modify the inhibitory effects of glucocorticoids on IL-6 release. Collectively, these studies suggest that ANXA1 supports aspects of adipose tissue mass and alters the sensitivity of epididymal adipose tissue to catecholamines, glucocorticoids, and LPS, thereby modulating lipolysis and IL-6 release.",

METHODS: Cyclooxygenase activity and selectivity was determined in vitro by measuring prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) production following incubation of varying concentrations of NSAID with human recombinant COX-1 or COX-2 and arachidonic acid. Anti-inflammatory effects were evaluated in a rabbit model in which an ocular inflammatory response was induced by intravenous injection of 10 microg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In study animals, one eye was treated with 50 microL (+/-) ketorolac 0.4% (Acular LS) or bromfenac 0.09% (Xibrom) and the other eye with 50 microL buffered saline. In control animals, both eyes were treated with vehicle. All animals were treated twice: 2 hours and 1 hour before LPS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: PGE(2) production in vitro, measured by enzyme immunoassay; fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran leakage into the anterior chamber, measured by fluorophotometry; aqueous PGE(2) levels in vivo, measured by ELISA immunoassay. RESULTS: Ketorolac was six times more active against COX-1 (IC(50) = 0.02 microM) than COX-2 (IC(50) = 0.12 microM) while bromfenac was approximately 32 times more active against COX-2 (IC(50) = 0.0066 microM) than COX-1 (IC(50) = 0.210 microM). In the animal model, both drugs resulted in nearly complete inhibition of FITC-dextran leakage and PGE(2) production in the anterior chamber of treated eyes. There was also a 79% inhibition (p < 0.001) of FITC-dextran leakage in the contralateral eyes of bromfenac-treated rabbits, and a 22.5% inhibition (not statistically significant) in the contralateral eyes of ketorolac-treated rabbits. CONCLUSIONS: Ketorolac is relatively COX-1 selective while bromfenac is potently selective for COX-2 over COX-1. In the animal model, both ketorolac 0.4% and bromfenac 0.09% demonstrated maximal anti-inflammatory activity in treated eyes. Only bromfenac 0.09% had a significant effect on the contralateral eye, suggesting possible systemic absorption of this drug.",

Recent data indicate that irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is linked to inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract.

Four graded (0.4-1.6 ml of water) CRDs were produced in conscious rats, and colorectal sensitivity and pain were assessed by measuring the abdominal withdrawal response and spinal c-Fos expression. In healthy rats, ATB-429 dose dependently (25, 50, or 100 mg/kg) attenuated CRD-induced hypersensitivity and significantly inhibited CRD-induced overexpression of spinal c-FOS mRNA, whereas mesalamine had no effect. ATB-429-induced antinociception was reversed by glibenclamide, a ATP-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP)) channel inhibitor. The antinociceptive effect of ATB-429 was maintained in a rodent model of postinflammatory hypersensitivity (4 weeks after colitis induction). At a dose of 100 mg/kg, ATB-429 reversed the allodynic response caused by CRD in postcolitic rats. Colonic cyclooxygenase-2 and interkeukin-1beta mRNA and spinal c-FOS mRNA expression were significantly down-regulated by ATB-429, but not by mesalamine. ATB-429, but not mesalamine, increased blood concentrations of H(2)S in both healthy and postcolitic rats. Taken together, these data suggest that ATB-429 inhibits hypersensitivity induced by CRD in both healthy and postcolitic, allodynic rats by a K(ATP) channel-mediated mechanism.

New data for cattle (Bos taurus) indicates a gene encoding GnRH-II decapeptide possessing arginine (codon: CGG) rather than tryptophan (TGG) at position three in the mature peptide. This substitution is unique. We confirmed the DNA sequence after cloning part of the bovine prepro-GnRH-II gene. Bovine GnRH-II peptide was synthesized and pharmacologically characterized. It did not bind to mammalian GnRH receptors expressed in different types of cell nor did it exhibit agonist or antagonist properties on types I or II GnRH receptors expressed in COS-7 cells. Bovine primers facilitated cloning of ovine GnRH-II DNA. A premature stop codon (TGA) replaces the expected tryptophan codon at position seven of GnRH-II in sheep DNA. Thus, both species possess prepro-GnRH-II genes encoding inactive peptides, as previously described for chimpanzee GnRH-II. The updated bovine type II GnRH receptor gene sequence revealed inactivation by frame shifts, premature stop codons, and nucleotide changes specifying nonconservative replacement of amino acid residues, similar to inactivation of sheep type II GnRH receptor. Spliced RNA transcripts from the disrupted receptor gene were not detected in bovine pituitary. In contrast, bovine prepro-GnRH-I and type I GnRH receptor genes are intact, encoding well-conserved protein sequences. These findings, and previous descriptions of inactivation of the human type II GnRH receptor and deletions of prepro-GnRH-II and type II GnRH receptor in laboratory rodents, suggest the GnRH-II system has been replaced by the GnRH-I system or is redundant in certain mammals.",

However, large doses of clenbuterol can induce cardiomyocyte death, and it is not known which of these agents has the most favourable therapeutic profile. We have investigated the cardiotoxicity of clenbuterol and fenoterol alongside that of isoprenaline, and compared their haemodynamic effects. Wistar rats (n = 6 per group) were subcutaneously injected with each beta-agonist (0.003-3 mmol kg(-1)) or saline, and cardiomyocyte apoptosis was detected by caspase 3 immunohistochemistry. In a separate experiment, rats (n = 4) were given equivalent doses to those used in the myotoxicity studies, in a randomized cross-over design, and their blood pressure recorded via radiotelemetry. Injection of 0.3 mmol kg(-1) fenoterol or isoprenaline, but not clenbuterol, induced significant cardiomyocyte apoptosis (0.4 +/- 0.05%; P < 0.05). At 3 mmol kg(-1), all agonists induced apoptosis (fenoterol, 1.1 +/- 0.1%; isoprenaline, 0.9 +/- 0.8%; and clenbuterol, 0.4 +/- 0.07%; P < 0.05). beta(1)-Adrenoceptor antagonism (10 mg kg(-1) bisoprolol) prevented 92% (P < 0.05) of apoptosis induced by all three agonists, but clenbuterol-induced apoptosis could also be prevented by 96% (P < 0.05) by beta(2)-AR antagonism (10 mg kg(-1) ICI 118 551). Clenbuterol decreased diastolic (1.3- to 1.6-fold; P < 0.05) and systolic blood pressure (1.3-fold; P < 0.05), and doses > 0.3 mmol kg(-1) increased heart rate (1.4-fold; P < 0.05). Fenoterol increased heart rate (1.2- to 1.4-fold; P < 0.05), and doses > 0.3 mmol kg(-1) decreased diastolic blood pressure (1.3-fold; P < 0.05).

        "input": "Immunosuppressive drugs have been traditionally developed to prevent acute rejection and to improve short-term kidney transplant outcomes. There is still a medical need to improve outcomes among subgroups of patients at higher risk for graft loss and to reduce cardiovascular, infectious and malignancy-associated morbidity and mortality, and improve long-term adherence. Several new immunosuppressive agents and formulations are undergoing clinical investigation and are discussed in this review.A modified release tacrolimus formulation (MR4) for once-daily administration is undergoing phase III trials. It has been developed to be administered de novo or for maintenance using the same therapeutic target tacrolimus trough concentrations as for the original formulation. Belatacept (LEA29Y), a second generation cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte-associated antigen immunoglobulin (CTLA4-Ig), blocks the interaction between CD80/86 and CD28 costimulatory pathways. In phase II trials, belatacept was as effective as ciclosporin (cyclosporine) when administered in combination with basiliximab, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and corticosteroids. Currently, belatacept is undergoing phase III trials including one study in recipients of organs from expanded criteria donors. Inhibitors of the Janus protein tyrosine kinase (JAK)-3 show some selectivity for cells of the lymphoid lineage and have been shown to be effective in late preclinical transplant models. The most frequent adverse effects have been related to nonspecific binding to JAK2 kinases. CP-690550, a JAK3 inhibitor is currently in phase II clinical trials.FK778, is a synthetic malononitrilamide that targets the critical enzyme of the de novo pyrimidine synthesis, dihydroorotic acid dehydrogenase, and receptor-associated tyrosine kinases has completed phase II trials. FK778 also shows antiviral activities that have been tested in patients with polyomavirus nephropathy. Fingolimod (FTY720), a synthetic sphingosine phosphate receptor modulator that reduces the recirculation of lymphocytes to blood and peripheral tissues including inflammatory lesions and graft sites is undergoing phase III trials. Although the efficacy of fingolimod is similar to MMF in patients receiving full doses of ciclosporin, safety issues such as a negative chronotropic effect, macular oedema, pulmonary adverse reactions and graft function resulted in premature discontinuation of the development programme for kidney transplantation. Because there was no clear clinical benefit over treatment options, the clinical development programme of FK778 was discontinued.Finally, a new evolving strategy with powerful induction-induced prolonged T-cell depletion followed by low-dose immunosuppressive monotherapy is showing promising results.",

To address this issue and taking into account that effects of synthetic progestins are not only referable to action through the progesterone receptor but may also be mediated by other steroid receptors, we characterized cardiovascular function and inflammatory gene expression in aldosterone salt-treated rats on long-term administration of 17beta-estradiol, medroxyprogesterone acetate, and drospirenone, a new progestogen exhibiting antimineralocorticoid activity. The complex pattern of cardiovascular injury in ovariectomized Wistar rats induced by chronic aldosterone infusion plus a high-salt diet was significantly attenuated in sham-ovariectomized rats and by coadministration of 17beta-estradiol in ovariectomized animals after 8 weeks of continuous treatment. The beneficial role of 17beta-estradiol on blood pressure, cardiac hypertrophy, vascular osteopontin expression, perivascular fibrosis, and impaired NO-dependent relaxation of isolated aortic rings was completely abrogated by coadministration of medroxyprogesterone acetate. In contrast, drospirenone was either neutral or additive to 17beta-estradiol in protecting against aldosterone salt-induced cardiovascular injury and inflammation. The current results support the hypothesis of complex interactions among estrogen, progesterone, glucocorticoid, androgen, and mineralocorticoid receptor signaling in cardiovascular injury and inflammation. Novel progestins, such as drospirenone, confer superior effects compared with medroxyprogesterone acetate in a model of aldosterone-induced heart disease because of its antimineralocorticoid properties.",

        "input": "Licofelone, a dual anti-inflammatory drug that inhibits 5-lipoxygenase (LOX) and cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, may have a better cardiovascular profile that cycloxygenase-2 inhibitors due to cycloxygenase-1 blockade-mediated antithrombotic effect and a better gastrointestinal tolerability. We examined the anti-inflammatory effect of licofelone on atherosclerotic lesions as well as in isolated neutrophils from whole blood of rabbits compared with a selective inhibitor of COX-2, rofecoxib. We also assessed the antithrombotic effect of licofelone in rabbit platelet-rich plasma. For this purpose, 30 rabbits underwent injury of femoral arteries, and they were randomized to receive 10 mg/kg/day licofelone or 5 mg/kg/day rofecoxib or no treatment during 4 weeks with atherogenic diet in all cases. Ten healthy rabbits were used as controls. Neutrophils and platelets were isolated from peripheral blood of rabbits for ex vivo studies. Licofelone reduced intima/media ratio in injured arteries, the macrophages infiltration in the neointimal area, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) gene expression, and the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB in rabbit atheroma. Moreover, licofelone inhibited COX-2 and 5-LOX protein expression in vascular lesions. Rofecoxib only diminished COX-2 protein expression and MCP-1 gene expression in vascular atheroma. Prostaglandin E(2) in rabbit plasma was attenuated by both drugs. Licofelone almost abolished 5-LOX activity by inhibiting leukotriene B4 generation in rabbit neutrophils and prevented platelet thromboxane B2 production from whole blood. Licofelone reduces neointimal formation and inflammation in an atherosclerotic rabbit model more markedly than rofecoxib. This effect, together with the antiplatelet activity of licofelone, suggests that this drug may have a favorable cardiovascular profile.",

OBJECTIVES: We have compared two synthetic glucorticoids, dexamethasone and prednisolone, in their ability to suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in depressed patients. Dexamethasone probes glucocorticoid receptor (GR) function, while prednisolone probes both GR and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) function. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used a single-blind, repeated-measure design. We administered placebo, prednisolone (5 mg) or dexamethasone (0.5 mg), at 22:00, to 18 severe, treatment-resistant depressed inpatients (15 of them with a history of childhood trauma) and 14 healthy volunteers. On the following days, we collected salivary cortisol from 9:00 to 22:00. RESULTS: Depressed patients had higher salivary cortisol levels compared with controls, at baseline and after both prednisolone and dexamethasone (p<0.001). Consistent with previous studies, depressed inpatients showed impaired suppression by dexamethasone: based on the analysis of the areas under the curve (AUCs), suppression by dexamethasone (0.5 mg) was -85% in controls vs -46% in depressed patients (p=0.018). However, the same depressed patients showed normal suppression by prednisolone (5 mg): suppression was -41% in controls and -36% in depressed patients (p=0.6). CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that the additional effects of prednisolone on the MR explain the different responses to these glucocorticoids in the same depressed patients.",

        "input": "Insulin receptors are widely distributed in the kidney and affect multiple aspects of renal function. In the proximal tubule, insulin regulates volume and acid-base regulation through stimulation of the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger NHE3. This paper characterizes the signaling pathway by which insulin stimulates NHE3 in a cell culture model [opossum kidney (OK) cell]. Insulin has two distinct phases of action on NHE3. Chronic insulin (24 h) activates NHE3 through the classic phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-serum- and glucocorticoid-dependent kinase 1 (PI3K-SGK1) pathway as insulin stimulates SGK1 phosphorylation and the insulin effect can be blocked by the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin or a dominant-negative SGK1. We showed that SGK1 transcript and protein are expressed in rat proximal tubule and OK cells. We previously showed that glucocorticoids augment the effect of insulin on NHE3 (Klisic J, Hu MC, Nief V, Reyes L, Fuster D, Moe OW, Ambuhl PM. Am J Physiol Renal Physiol 283: F532-F539, 2002). Part of this can be mediated via induction of SGK1 by glucocorticoids, and indeed the insulin effect on NHE3 can also be amplified by overexpression of SGK1. We next addressed the acute effect of insulin (1-2 h) on NHE3 by systematically examining the candidate signaling cascades and activation mechanisms of NHE3. We ruled out the PI3K-SGK1-Akt and TC10 pathways, increased surface NHE3, NHE3 phosphorylation, NHE3 association with calcineurin homologous protein 1 or megalin as mechanisms of acute activation of NHE3 by insulin. In summary, insulin stimulates NHE3 acutely via yet undefined pathways and mechanisms. The chronic effect of insulin is mediated by the classic PI3K-SGK1 route.",

        "input": "Estrogens are biosynthesised from androgens by the CYP450 enzyme complex called aromatase. Aromatase is expressed in the ovary, placenta, brain, bone, adipose tissue and breast tissue. In breast cancer, intratumoural aromatase is the source for local estrogen production in the tissue. Inhibition of aromatase is an important approach for reducing growth stimulatory effects of estrogens in estrogen-dependent breast cancer. The potent and selective third-generation aromatase inhibitors anastrozole, letrozole and exemestane were introduced to the market as endocrine therapy in postmenopausal patients failing anti-estrogen therapy alone, or multiple hormonal therapies. Anastrozole and letrozole are both non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors that compete with the substrate for binding to the enzyme active site. Exemestane is a mechanism-based steroidal inhibitor that mimics the substrate, is converted by the enzyme to a reactive intermediate, and results in inactivation of aromatase. These third-generation aromatase inhibitors are currently approved as first-line therapy for the treatment of postmenopausal women with metastatic estrogen-dependent breast cancer. The use of an aromatase inhibitor as initial therapy, or after treatment with tamoxifen, is now recommended as adjuvant hormonal therapy for postmenopausal women with hormone-dependent breast cancer. Several clinical studies of aromatase inhibitors focus on the use of these agents in the adjuvant setting, for the treatment of early breast cancer. Recently published results show improved responses with these agents compared with tamoxifen.",

TLR activation is closely linked to the development of many chronic inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis. Auranofin, an Au(I) compound, is a well-known and long-used anti-rheumatic drug. However, the mechanism as to how auranofin relieves the symptom of rheumatoid arthritis has not been fully clarified. Our results demonstrated that auranofin suppressed TLR4-mediated activation of transcription factors, NF-kappaB and IRF3, and expression of COX-2, a pro-inflammatory enzyme. This suppression was well correlated with the inhibitory effect of auranofin on the homodimerization of TLR4 induced by an agonist. Furthermore, auranofin inhibited NF-kappaB activation induced by MyD88-dependent downstream signaling components of TLR4, MyD88, IKKbeta, and p65. IRF3 activation induced by MyD88-independent signaling components, TRIF and TBK1, was also downregulated by auranofin. Our results first demonstrate that auranofin suppresses the multiple steps in TLR4 signaling, especially the homodimerization of TLR4. The results suggest that the suppression of TLR4 activity by auranofin may be the molecular mechanism through which auranofin exerts anti-rheumatic activity.",

        "input": "Heterocyclic and aromatic amine carcinogens are thought to lead to tumor initiation via the formation of DNA adducts, and bioactivation to arylhydroxylamine metabolites is necessary for reactivity with DNA. Carcinogenic arylhydroxylamine metabolites are cleared by a microsomal, NADH-dependent, oxygen-insensitive reduction pathway in humans, which may be a source of interindividual variability in response to aromatic amine carcinogens. The purpose of this study was to characterize the identity of this reduction pathway in human liver. On the basis of our findings with structurally similar arylhydroxylamine metabolites of therapeutic drugs, we hypothesized that the reductive detoxification of arylhydroxylamine carcinogens was catalyzed by NADH cytochrome b5 reductase (b5R) and cytochrome b5 (cyt b5). We found that reduction of the carcinogenic hydroxylamines of the aromatic amine 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP; found in cigarette smoke) and the heterocyclic amine 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo [4,5-b] pyridine (PhIP; found in grilled meats) was indeed catalyzed by a purified system containing only human b5R and cyt b5. Specific activities were 56-346-fold higher in the purified system as compared to human liver microsomes (HLM), with similar Michaelis-Menten constants (K(m) values) in both systems. The stoichiometry for b5R and cyt b5 that yielded the highest activity in the purified system was also similar to that found in native HLM ( approximately 1:8 to 1:10). Polyclonal antisera to either b5R or cyt b5 significantly inhibited N-hydroxy-4-aminobiphenyl (NHOH-4-ABP) reduction by 95 and 89%, respectively, and immunoreactive cyt b5 protein content in individual HLM was significantly correlated with individual reduction of both NHOH-4-ABP and N-hydroxy-PhIP (NHOH-PhIP). Finally, titration of HLM into the purified b5R/cyt b5 system did not enhance the efficiency of reduction activity. We conclude that b5R and cyt b5 are together solely capable of the reduction of arylhydroxylamine carcinogens, and we further hypothesize that this pathway may be a source of individual variability with respect to cancer susceptibility following 4-ABP or PhIP exposure.",

Given that M-CSF signalling through c-FMS plays an important role in osteoclast biology, we speculated that blocking such a pathway with imatinib may modulate osteoclast activity. Using a cell model of mature rabbit osteoclasts, we thus investigated the effect of imatinib on in vitro osteoclast apoptosis and bone resorbing activity. Our findings demonstrate that imatinib dose-dependently stimulates osteoclast apoptosis, a phenomenon which is blocked by the caspase I inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk. The ability of imatinib to enhance osteoclast cell death was accompanied by a dose-dependent inhibition of osteoclast bone resorbing activity. Imatinib was also found to inhibit M-CSF-induced osteoclast survival as well as M-CSF-induced osteoclast bone resorbing activity, but was without effect on interleukin 1alpha (IL-1alpha) and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL)-induced inhibition of osteoclasts apoptosis, further supporting the hypothesis that imatinib may affect mature osteoclasts through the inhibition of c-FMS.

No differences in the striatal/occipital (S/O) ratio or plasma levels were found between examinations at the 48-h time point and when a stable dose level had been established, so these parameters could not account for the latency period required for clinical response. D2 receptor occupancy at 48 h correlated positively with clinical improvement after 2 weeks of treatment.

One day after olanzapine treatment ceased, rats were tested on the place and match-to-place versions of the Morris water maze (MWM) for seven consecutive days. Dopamine D2 receptor priming was verified through a yawning behavioural test, a D2 receptor-mediated event, before olanzapine was administered as well as after olanzapine treatment and behavioural testing were complete. Results showed that neonatal quinpirole treatment induced D2 priming that was eliminated by olanzapine treatment. On the MWM place version, D2-primed rats demonstrated a significant impairment that was eliminated by olanzapine treatment, but olanzapine treatment to animals neonatally treated with saline produced a significant deficit on the place version of the MWM. There were no significant deficits on the match-to-place version. Brain tissue analyses revealed that neonatal quinpirole treatment produced a significant decrease in hippocampal NGF, BDNF and ChAT that was eliminated by olanzapine treatment. Neonatal quinpirole treatment produced a significant decrease in BDNF and ChAT in the frontal cortex that was unaffected by olanzapine treatment.

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Histamine synthesized by histidine decarboxylase (HDC) from L-histidine is a major chemical mediator in the development of nasal allergy which is characterized by nasal hypersensitivity. However the regulatory mechanism of histamine synthesis by HDC remains to be elucidated. The objectives of the present study were to examine the changes of histamine content, HDC activity and HDC mRNA expression in the nasal mucosa of allergy model rats sensitized by the exposure to toluene diisocyanate (TDI) and to investigate the effect of dexamethasone on the above mentioned allergic parameters. METHODS: Rats were sensitized and provocated by TDI and the nasal allergy-like behaviors were scored during a 10 minute period after provocation. Histamine content and HDC activity in the nasal mucosa were determined using fluorometric high performance liquid chromatography. The expression of HDC mRNA in nasal mucosa was determined using real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: In TDI-sensitized rats, nasal allergy-like behaviors such as sneezing and watery rhinorrhea were induced. Histamine content, HDC activity and HDC mRNA expression in nasal mucosa were also significantly increased after TDI provocation. Pretreatment with dexamethasone significantly suppressed nasal allergy-like behaviors, up-regulation of histamine content, HDC activity and HDC mRNA induced by TDI in TDI-sensitized rats. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that increased synthesis of histamine through up-regulation of HDC gene expression and HDC activity in nasal mucosa plays an important role in the development of nasal hypersensitivity. Repression of HDC gene expression and HDC activity by dexamethasone may underlie its therapeutic effect in the treatment of allergy.",

We therefore examined the associations of the A66G and C524T polymorphisms of the MTRR gene with bone mineral density (BMD) and serum osteocalcin levels in postmenopausal women. Although we did not detect any significant associations between MTRR polymorphisms and BMD or serum osteocalcin levels, we found that the 66G/524C haplotype, which has reduced enzyme activity, was significantly associated with serum osteocalcin levels in a gene-dose dependent manner (P = 0.002). That is, the highest osteocalcin levels (34.5 +/- 16.8 ng/ml) were observed in subjects bearing two copies, intermediate osteocalcin levels (32.6 +/- 14.4 ng/ml) were observed in subjects bearing one copy, and the lowest levels of osteocalcin (28.8 +/- 10.9 ng/ml) were observed in subjects bearing no copies.

GPxs reduce hydroperoxides to the corresponding alcohols by means of glutathione (GSH). They have long been considered to only act as antioxidant enzymes. Increasing evidence, however, suggests that nature has not created redundant GPxs just to detoxify hydroperoxides. cGPx clearly acts as an antioxidant, as convincingly demonstrated in GPx1-knockout mice. PHGPx specifically interferes with NF-kappaB activation by interleukin-1, reduces leukotriene and prostanoid biosynthesis, prevents COX-2 expression, and is indispensable for sperm maturation and embryogenesis. GI-GPx, which is not exclusively expressed in the gastrointestinal system, is upregulated in colon and skin cancers and in certain cultured cancer cells. GI-GPx is a target for Nrf2, and thus is part of the adaptive response by itself, while PHGPx might prevent cancer by interfering with inflammatory pathways. In conclusion, cGPx, PHGPx and GI-GPx have distinct roles, particularly in cellular defence mechanisms.

The non-selective adenosine receptor antagonist (caffeine), and the selective adenosine A1 receptor antagonist (DPCPX), injected 15 min before the application of pentetrazole and flumazenil, were able to intensify BDZ withdrawal signs in mice. The most apparent effects were observed after administration of DPCPX, indicating that the adenosine A1 receptor may play a more important role in these effects.

        "input": "RATIONALE: Flupentixol (FLX) has been used as a neuroleptic for nearly 4 decades. In vitro data show comparable affinity to dopamine D(2), D(1) and 5-HT(2A) receptors and recently, FLX showed to be not inferior to risperidone in schizophrenic patients with predominant negative symptomatology, which was implicated with flupentixol's interaction with 5-HT(2A) and/or D(1) receptors. OBJECTIVES: To assess in vivo receptor occupancy (RO) in patients clinically treated with FLX (n = 13, 5.7 +/- 1.4 mg/day) in comparison with risperidone (RIS, n = 11, 3.6 +/- 1.3 mg/day) and haloperidol (HAL, n = 11, 8.5 +/- 5.5 mg/day). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Each patient underwent two PET scans with 3-N-[(11)C]methylspiperone (target: frontal 5-HT(2A)), [(11)C]SCH23390 (striatal D(1)) or [(11)C]raclopride (striatal D(2)). RO was calculated as the percentage reduction of specific binding in comparison with healthy controls. RESULTS: D(2)-RO under FLX was between 50% and 70%, indicating an ED(50) of about 0.7 ng/ml serum. 5-HT(2A) and D(1)-RO was 20 +/- 10% and 20 +/- 5% (mean, SEM). Under HAL, D(1)-RO was 14 +/- 6% and under RIS not significantly different from zero. CONCLUSIONS: We were able to demonstrate a moderate 5-HT(2A) and D(1) occupancy under clinically relevant doses of flupentixol, albeit lower than expected from in vitro data and clearly below saturation. Therefore, if flupentixol's efficacy on negative symptoms is based on its interaction with 5-HT(2A) and/or D(1) receptors, it should be highly dependent on serum concentration and thus on dosage and metabolism. However, these data suggest that mechanisms other than D(1) or 5-HT(2A) antagonism may contribute to flupentixol's efficacy on negative symptoms.",

Using a proteomics approach, we demonstrate that creatine kinase B (CKB) interacts with Asb-9 in a specific, SOCS box-independent manner. This interaction increases the polyubiquitylation of CKB and decreases total CKB levels within the cell.

METHODS: We investigated activities of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in brain areas (frontal cortex, basal ganglia, septum and hippocampus) and the hypophysis, and that of butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) in plasma and liver. RESULTS: Following administration of the highest of the GAL doses used (2.5; 5; 10 mg/kg i.m.), AChE activity decreased mainly in the frontal cortex, hippocampus and hypophysis. In the interaction of GAL and CAR, AChE inhibition was stronger but without any statistical significance. The peripheral inhibition of BuChE was found to be dose-dependent.

Pharmacogenetic analysis of two genes, the warfarin metabolic enzyme CYP2C9 and warfarin target enzyme, vitamin K epoxide reductase complex 1 VKORC1, confirmed their influence on warfarin maintenance dose. Possession of CYP2C9*2 or CYP2C9*3 variant alleles, which result in decreased enzyme activity, is associated with a significant decrease in the mean warfarin dose. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in VKORC1 are associated with warfarin dose across the normal dose range. Haplotypes based on these SNPs explain a large fraction of the interindividual variation in warfarin dose, and VKORC1 has an approximately three-fold greater effect than CYP2C9.

The successful use of the arginine-depleting enzyme arginine deiminase (ADI) to treat ASS-deficient tumors has opened up new possibilities for effective cancer therapy. Nevertheless, many ASS-positive HCC cell lines are found to be resistant to ADI treatment, although most require arginine for proliferation. Thus far, an arginine-depleting enzyme for killing ASS-positive tumors has not been reported. Here, we provide direct evidence that recombinant human arginase (rhArg) inhibits ASS-positive HCCs. All the five human HCC cell lines we used were sensitive to rhArg but ADI had virtually no effect on these cells. They all expressed ASS, but not ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), the enzyme that converts ornithine, the product of degradation of arginine with rhArg, to citrulline, which is converted back to arginine via ASS. Transfection of HCC cells with OTC resulted in resistance to rhArg. Thus, OTC expression alone may be sufficient to induce rhArg resistance in ASS-positive HCC cells. This surprising correlation between the lack of OTC expression and sensitivity of ASS-positive HCC cells shows that OTC-deficient HCCs are sensitive to rhArg-mediated arginine depletion. Therefore, pretreatment tumor gene expression profiling of ASS and OTC could aid in predicting tumor response to arginine depletion with arginine-depleting enzymes. We have also shown that the rhArg native enzyme and the pegylated rhArg (rhArg-peg(5,000mw)) gave similar anticancer efficacy in vitro. Furthermore, the growth of the OTC-deficient Hep3B tumor cells (ASS-positive and ADI-resistant) in mice was inhibited by treatment with rhArg-peg(5,000mw), which is active alone and is synergistic in combination with 5-fluorouracil. Thus, our data suggest that rhArg-peg(5,000mw) is a novel agent for effective cancer therapy.",

        "input": "Metabolism of vitamin A, all-trans-retinol, leads to the formation of 11-cis-retinaldehyde, the visual chromophore, and all-trans-retinoic acid, which is involved in the regulation of gene expression through the retinoic acid receptor. Enzymes and binding proteins involved in retinoid metabolism are highly conserved across species. We previously described a novel mammalian enzyme that saturates the 13-14 double bond of all-trans-retinol to produce all-trans-13,14-dihydroretinol, which then follows the same metabolic fate as that of all-trans-retinol. Specifically, all-trans-13,14-dihydroretinol is transiently oxidized to all-trans-13,14-dihydroretinoic acid before being oxidized further by Cyp26 enzymes. Here, we report the identification of two putative RetSat homologues in zebrafish, one of which, zebrafish RetSat A (zRetSat A), also had retinol saturase activity, whereas zebrafish RetSat B (zRetSat B) was inactive under similar conditions. Unlike mouse RetSat (mRetSat), zRetSat A had an altered bond specificity saturating either the 13-14 or 7-8 double bonds of all-trans-retinol to produce either all-trans-13,14-dihydroretinol or all-trans-7,8-dihydroretinol, respectively. zRetSat A also saturated the 13-14 or 7-8 double bonds of all-trans-3,4-didehydroretinol (vitamin A2), a second endogenous form of vitamin A in zebrafish. The dual enzymatic activity of zRetSat A displays a newly acquired specificity for the 13-14 double bond retained in higher vertebrates and also the evolutionarily preserved activity of bacterial phytoene desaturases and plant carotenoid isomerases. Expression of zRetSat A was restricted to the liver and intestine of hatchlings and adult zebrafish, whereas zRetSat B was expressed in the same tissues but at earlier developmental stages. Exogenous all-trans-retinol, all-trans-13,14-dihydroretinol, or all-trans-7,8-dihydroretinol led to the strong induction of the expression of the retinoic acid-metabolizing enzyme, Cyp26A1, arguing for an active signaling function of dihydroretinoid metabolites in zebrafish.

In considering the various physiological roles that have been proposed for this relatively abundant molecule one is obliged to take into account its unusual metabolic compartmentalization, according to which synthesis and storage occur in the neuron and hydrolytic cleavage in the oligodendrocyte. The latter reaction, catalyzed by aspartoacylase (ASPA), produces acetyl groups plus aspartate and has been proposed to occur in both soluble and membranous subfractions of white matter. Our study supports such bimodal occurrence and we now present immunoblot, proteomic, and biochemical evidence that the membrane-bound form of ASPA is intrinsic to purified myelin membranes. This was supported by a novel TLC-based method for the assay of ASPA. That observation, together with previous demonstrations of numerous lipid-synthesizing enzymes in myelin, suggests utilization of acetyl groups liberated by myelin-localized ASPA for lipid synthesis within the myelin sheath.

        "input": "The etiology of preeclampsia is unknown but is thought to be related to hypoxia in the placenta. We previously reported that the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) has increased activity and gene expression in placentas from preeclamptic pregnancies [Tsoi SCM, Zheng J, Xu F, Kay HH. Differential expression of lactate dehydrogenase isozymes (LDH) in human placenta with high expression of LDH-A(4) isozyme in the endothelial cells of pre-eclampsia villi. Placenta 2001;22:317-22]. LDH is responsible for pyruvate conversion to lactate through glycolysis. In this study, we further investigated the role of hypoxia in primary trophoblast cells and a cultured cell line, JEG3 cells, to obtain a better understanding of how it affects the activities of lactate dehydrogenase, lactate production and regulatory genes, as a possible model for preeclampsia. Primary trophoblast cells and JEG3 cells were cultured under 1% oxygen. At 6, 12 and 24h, cells were analyzed for LDHA and LDHB isozyme activities, mRNA and protein expression compared to standard culture conditions. Lactate was measured from cell medium. The hypoxia inducible transcription factor (HIF-1alpha) protein expression was confirmed by western blot. Two lactate transporters (MCT1 and MCT4) mRNA and protein expression were also studied under hypoxia. Finally, lactate was measured in plasma obtained from patients with severe preeclampsia. Under hypoxic conditions, LDHA mRNA is increased in primary trophoblast cells and JEG3 cells. The HIF-1alpha protein expression is higher in hypoxia-treated JEG3 cells than control. LDHA isozyme activity and its protein expression are increased most significantly at 24h of culture under hypoxia. However, LDHB protein is unchanged while its mRNA is decreased. Lactate secretion from JEG3 cells under hypoxia is increased, as is the lactate levels in the plasma from preeclampsia patients. Of the two lactate transporters studied, MCT4 mRNA and protein level are increased under hypoxia. Our findings support the role of hypoxia in inducing HIF-1alpha activity in trophoblasts and increasing LDH transcription as well as its activity. Higher levels of lactate are produced and secreted which may contribute to the higher lactate levels in plasma of preeclamptic patients. These mechanisms may be important in the pathophysiology of preeclampsia.",

OBJECTIVE: The aim was to test whether the common deletion [T/-] in the promoter of FADS2 affects the PUFA biosynthetic pathway and consequently modifies the effect of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) on myocardial infarction (MI). DESIGN: Case subjects (n =1694) with a first nonfatal acute MI were matched by age, sex, and area of residence to 1694 population-based control subjects in Costa Rica. PUFAs were quantified by gas-liquid chromatography from plasma and adipose tissue samples. Least-squares means from generalized linear models and odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs from multiple conditional logistic regression models were estimated. RESULTS: The prevalence of the variant T/- allele was 48%. Eicosapentaenoic acid, gamma-linolenic acid, and arachidonic acid decreased in adipose tissue and plasma with increasing number of copies of the variant allele with a monotonic trend (P < 0.05 for all). Fasting plasma triacylglycerols by genotype were 2.08 mmol/L for TT, 2.16 mmol/L for T-, and 2.26 mmol/L for - - [ie, homozygous for the variant (deletion) allele] (P = 0.03). The FADS2 deletion was not associated with MI and did not significantly modify the association between adipose tissue ALA and the risk of MI. CONCLUSIONS: The FADS2 deletion may prevent the conversion of ALA into very-long-chain PUFAs. However, this metabolic effect is not translated into an attenuated risk between ALA and MI among carriers of the variant. It is possible that, at current intakes of ALA, any potential defect in the transcription of the gene is masked by the availability of substrate. Further research in populations deficient in ALA intake is warranted.",

Although much is known about ecto-5'-nucleotidase, the renal ecto-phosphodiesterase remains uncharacterized. We administered cAMP (10 microM in the perfusate) to 12 different groups of perfused kidneys. AMP was measured in perfusate using ion trap mass spectrometry. In control kidneys (n=19), basal renal secretion rate of AMP was 0.49+/-0.08 and increased to 3.0+/-0.2 nmol AMP/g kidney weight/min during administration of cAMP. A broad-spectrum phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor (1,3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 300 microM, n=6) and an ecto-phosphodiesterase inhibitor (1,3-dipropyl-8-p-sulfophenylxanthine, 1 mM, n=6) significantly attenuated cAMP-induced AMP secretion by 60 and 74%, respectively.

However, a lower concentration of dipyridamole (3 microM) that blocks PDE9, PDE10, and PDE11, but not PDE8, did not inhibit ecto-phosphodiesterase activity. These data support the conclusion that renal ecto-phosphodiesterase activity is not mediated by PDE1, PDE2, PDE3, PDE4, PDE5, PDE6, PDE7, PDE9, PDE10, or PDE11 and is inhibited by high concentrations of dipyridamole.

Gene expression profiling (GEP) of GIST-S, GIST-R cells and two IM resistant GIST patients demonstrated that KIT is downregulated implying a major role in IM resistance. Instead, GIST-R cells have acquired IM resistance by overexpressing the oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase - AXL - in a 'kinase switch'. Further, the two IM resistant GIST patients express AXL and not c-Kit, seen by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting of the GIST-S and GIST-R cells confirmed the switch from Kit to AXL. In GIST-R, AXL is tyrosine phosphorylated and its ligand growth-arrest-specific gene 6 is overexpressed implying autocrine activation. The kinase switch is associated with a morphological change from spindle to epithelioid. Molecular modeling of the kinase domain of mutant c-Kit (V654A) and AXL showed no binding to IM but efficient binding to MP470, a novel c-Kit/AXL kinase inhibitor.

The current study evaluates the specificity of Cyp1a1 induction as a marker for AhR affinity and activation and provides context to assess the relevancy of AhR activation to risk assessment. In vivo experiments examined the expression of Cyp1a1 and other AhR-regulated genes in liver, kidney, and heart in response to 596 compounds. From this data set, a subset of 147 compounds was then evaluated for their ability to activate or bind to the AhR using a combination of gel shift, reporter gene, and competitive receptor binding assays. Whereas in vivo Cyp1a1 mRNA expression is a sensitive marker for AhR activation, it lacks specificity, because 81 (59%) of 137 compounds were found to significantly induce Cyp1a1 in vivo but were not verified to bind or activate the AhR in vitro. Combining in vivo and in vitro findings, we identified nine AhR agonists, six of which are marketed therapeutics and have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, including leflunomide, flutamide, and nimodipine. These drugs do not produce dioxin-like toxicity in rats or in humans.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of the current study was to assess the activity of rolipram, a nonsubtype-selective PDE4 inhibitor, in several animal models predictive of antipsychotic-like efficacy and side-effect liability and to use PDE4B wild-type and knockout mice to begin to understand the subtypes involved in the activity of rolipram. RESULTS: In rats, rolipram antagonized both phencyclidine hydrochloride- and D-amphetamine-induced hyperactivity and inhibited conditioned avoidance responding (CAR). In PDE4B wild-type mice, rolipram dose-dependently suppressed CAR (ED(50) = 2.4 mg/kg); however, in knockout mice, their sensitivity to rolipram at the higher doses (1.0 and 3.2 mg/kg) was reduced, resulting in a threefold shift in the ED(50) (7.3 mg/kg), suggesting PDE4B is involved, at least in part, with the activity of rolipram. Only the highest dose of rolipram (3.2 mg/kg) produced a modest but significant degree of catalepsy. CONCLUSIONS: Rolipram has a pharmacologic profile similar to that of the atypical antipsychotics and has low extrapyramidal symptom liability. These results suggest that PDE4B mediates the antipsychotic effects of rolipram in CAR and that the PDE4B-regulated cyclic adenosine monophosphate signaling pathway may play a role in the pathophysiology and pharmacotherapy of psychosis.",

Many studies have found an association between human cancer and exposure to agricultural pesticides such as the organophosphorous pesticides. Parathion is a cholinesterase inhibitor that induces the hydrolysis of body choline esters, including acetylcholine at cholinergic synapses. The primary target of action in insects is the nervous system whereby pesticides inhibit the release of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase at the synaptic junction. Atropine is a parasympatholytic alkaloid used as an antidote to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of parathion and atropine on cell transformation of human breast epithelial cells in vitro. These studies showed that parathion alone was able to induce malignant transformation of an immortalized human breast epithelial cell line, MCF-10F as indicated by increased cell proliferation, anchorage independency and invasive capabilities. There was also an increase in c-kit, Trio, Rho-A, Rac-3, EGFR, Notch-4, Dvl-2, Ezrin, beta catenin and mutant p53 protein expression in the parathion-treated cells. However, atropine significantly inhibited this increase. In a human cell cycle array of 96 genes, 13 of them were altered by parathion treatment. Among the genes affected were the cyclins, such as cyclin D3, the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) such as CDK41 and the minichromosome maintenance deficient (MCM) MCM2 and MCM3.

It is suggested that the lack of pro-oxidant effects in vivo associated with amtolmetin guacyl treatment contribute improved gastric tolerability.",

        "input": "INTRODUCTION: The Bradford Hill criteria are a widely used, useful tool for the assessment of biomedical causation. We have examined their application to pharmacovigilance using the example of cisapride-induced QTc interval prolongation/arrhythmia. METHODS: A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Reactions Weekly and regulatory websites to identify evidence for the association between cisapride and QTc interval prolongation/arrhythmia that had been published in the English language. Two hundred and five publications were identified as being potentially suitable for the study. After excluding irrelevant articles, studies on high-risk populations and review articles, 70 publications were assessed using the Bradford Hill criteria. These included 24 case reports, case series or spontaneous report summaries; eight epidemiological studies; 22 clinical studies; and 16 experimental (in vivo and in vitro) publications. RESULTS: The most compelling evidence for an association between cisapride use and QTc interval prolongation/arrhythmia came from case/spontaneous reports and biological plausibility. Considering the rare incidence of serious cardiac events, these criteria formed the basis for the strength of the association. The number of reports from different populations showed consistency. Specificity was supported by clinical and cardiographic characterisation of the events. There were temporal relationships between the events and the initiation of cisapride treatment, increases in the dosage and the receipt of interacting medications. The relationships between the adverse events and the latter two factors exhibited biological gradients. Experimental evidence could be found from biological models, as well as reports of positive dechallenge and/or rechallenge found in individual patients. Cisapride was found to bind the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG) potassium channel, which provides a plausible mechanism for QTc interval prolongation/arrhythmia. Other QTc interval-prolonging/arrhythmic drugs that also bind to HERG provided an analogy for cisapride causing QTc interval prolongation/arrhythmia via this mechanism. The evidence provided by clinical studies was inconsistent, and epidemiological studies failed to demonstrate an association. Nevertheless, this did not prevent the assessment of causation. DISCUSSION: This study showed how different types of evidence found in pharmacovigilance can be evaluated using the Bradford Hill criteria. Further work is required to examine how the criteria can be applied to different types of adverse events and how they may be applied to pharmacovigilance.",

        "input": "To determine the role of 14-3-3 in colorectal cancer apoptosis induced by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), we evaluated the effects of sulindac on 14-3-3epsilon protein expression in colorectal cancer cells. Sulindac sulfide inhibited 14-3-3epsilon proteins in HT-29 and DLD-1 cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Sulindac sulfone at 600 mumol/L inhibited 14-3-3epsilon protein expression in HT-29. Indomethacin and SC-236, a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, exerted a similar effect as sulindac. Sulindac suppressed 14-3-3epsilon promoter activity. As 14-3-3epsilon promoter activation is mediated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARdelta), we determined the correlation between 14-3-3epsilon inhibition and PPARdelta suppression by NSAIDs. Sulindac sulfide inhibited PPARdelta protein expression and PPARdelta transcriptional activity. Overexpression of PPARdelta by adenoviral transfer rescued 14-3-3epsilon proteins from elimination by sulindac or indomethacin. NSAID-induced 14-3-3epsilon suppression was associated with reduced cytosolic Bad with elevation of mitochondrial Bad and increase in apoptosis which was rescued by Ad-PPARdelta transduction. Stable expression of 14-3-3epsilon in HT-29 significantly protected cells from apoptosis. Our findings shed light on a novel mechanism by which NSAIDs induce colorectal cancer apoptosis via the PPARdelta/14-3-3epsilon transcriptional pathway. These results suggest that 14-3-3epsilon is a target for the prevention and therapy of colorectal cancer.",

        "input": "The dependence of regulatory volume decrease (RVD) activity on potassium-chloride cotransporter (KCC) isoform expression was characterized in corneal epithelial cells (CEC). During exposure to a 50% hypotonic challenge, the RVD response was larger in SV40-immortalized human CEC (HCEC) than in SV40-immortalized rabbit CEC (RCEC). A KCC inhibitor-[(dihydroindenyl)oxy] alkanoic acid (DIOA)-blocked RVD more in HCEC than RCEC. Under isotonic conditions, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) produced KCC activation and transient cell shrinkage. Both of these changes were greater in HCEC than in RCEC. Immunoblot analysis of HCEC, RCEC, primary human CEC (pHCEC), and primary bovine CEC (BCEC) plasma membrane enriched fractions revealed KCC1, KCC3, and KCC4 isoform expression, whereas KCC2 was undetectable. During a hypotonic challenge, KCC1 membrane content increased more rapidly in HCEC than in RCEC. Such a challenge induced a larger increase and more transient p44/42MAPK activation in HCEC than RCEC. On the other hand, HCEC and RCEC p38MAPK phosphorylation reached peak activations at 2.5 and 15 min, respectively. Only in HCEC, pharmacological manipulation of KCC activity modified the hypotonicity-induced activation of p44/42MAPK, whereas p38MAPK phosphorylation was insensitive to such procedures in both cell lines. Larger increases in HCEC KCC1 membrane protein content correlated with their ability to undergo faster and more complete RVD. Furthermore, pharmacological activation of KCC increased p44/42MAPK phosphorylation in HCEC but not in RCEC, presumably a reflection of low KCC1 membrane expression in RCEC. These findings suggest that KCC1 plays a role in (i) maintaining isotonic steady-state cell volume homeostasis, (ii) recovery of isotonic cell volume after a hypotonic challenge through RVD, and (iii) regulating hypotonicity-induced activation of the p44/42MAPK signaling pathway required for cell proliferation.",

        "input": "PURPOSE: Dasatinib (BMS-354825), a potent oral multi-targeted kinase inhibitor against SRC and BCR-ABL, has recently been approved for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) in imatinib-acquired resistance and intolerance. In vitro and in vivo studies were conducted to characterize the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of dasatinib in mouse, rat, dog, and monkey. Possible mechanisms contributing to the incomplete oral bioavailability of dasatinib in animals were investigated. METHODS: Metabolic stability of dasatinib was measured after incubation with liver microsomes (either NADPH- or UDPGA-fortified) and isolated hepatocytes obtained from mouse, rat, dog, monkey, and human. In all cases, substrate depletion over time was measured, and appropriate scaling factors were used to predict in vivo clearance. Pharmacokinetics of dasatinib were determined in mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys after administration of single intravenous or oral doses. In addition, the routes of excretion were investigated after administration of dasatinib to bile duct cannulated (BDC) rats. Absorption and first-pass metabolism were evaluated as possible reasons for the incomplete oral bioavailability using various in vitro and in vivo models like Caco-2 cells, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) knockout mice, and intra-portal dosing in rats. RESULTS: In vivo systemic plasma clearance values of dasatinib were 62, 26, 25, and 34 ml/min/kg in mouse, rat, dog, and monkey, respectively. Scaling of in vitro hepatocyte and liver microsomal data gave reasonably good predictions of in vivo clearances across all species. Percent distribution in blood cells ranged from 43% in mouse to 57% in dog. Dasatinib showed high volumes of distribution (>3 l/kg) and high serum protein binding values (>90%) in all four species tested. Oral bioavailability of dasatinib ranged from 14% in the mouse to 34% in the dog. In rats, bioavailability after an intraportal dose was comparable to that after intra-arterial administration. In BDC rats, less than 15% of an intravenous dose was excreted unchanged in urine, bile, and the gastrointestinal tract, suggesting that dasatinib is cleared primarily via metabolism. Dasatinib has high intrinsic permeability in Caco-2 cells, however, the efflux ratio was approximately two-fold indicating that it may be a substrate for an intestinal efflux transporter. However, in vivo studies in P-gp knockout mice versus wild-type mice showed no difference in the amount of dasatinib remaining unabsorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, suggesting that P-gp may not be responsible for the incomplete bioavailability. CONCLUSIONS: Dasatinib shows intermediate clearance in mouse, rat, dog, and monkey, and distributes extensively in those species. Oxidative metabolism appears to be the predominant clearance pathway. The incomplete oral bioavailability may be due to both incomplete absorption and high first-pass metabolism. However, the efflux transporter, P-glycoprotein does not appear to be limiting oral absorption.",

        "input": "Lumiracoxib is the first example of a marketed COX-2 inhibitor of the arylacetic acid class, and it is reported to be the most selective COXIB in vivo. However, the molecular basis of its COX-2 inhibition has not been completely defined. Using standard assays, lumiracoxib was found to be a poor inhibitor of purified ovine COX-1 and a relatively weak inhibitor of purified human COX-2. The extent of COX-2 inhibition plateaued at around 50% and suggested that the inhibitor may be reversibly bound to the enzyme. Kinetic studies with lumiracoxib demonstrated that it was a time-dependent and slowly reversible inhibitor of human COX-2 that exhibited at least two binding steps during inhibition. Derivatives of lumiracoxib were synthesized with or without the methyl group on the phenylacetic acid ring and with various substitutions on the lower aniline ring. Inhibition studies demonstrated that the methyl group on the phenylacetic acid ring is required for COX-2 selectivity. The chemical identity and position of the substituents on the lower aniline ring were important in determining the potency and extent of COX inhibition as well as COX-2 selectivity. Mutation of Ser-530 to Ala or Val-349 to Ala or Leu abolished the potent inhibition observed with wild-type human COX-2 and key lumiracoxib analogs. Interestingly, a Val-349 to Ile mutant was inhibited with equal potency to human COX-2 with 2,6-dichloro-, 2,6-dimethyl-, or 2-chloro-6-methyl-substituted inhibitors and, in the case of lumiracoxib, actually showed an increase in potency. Taken together with a recent crystal structure of a lumiracoxib-COX-2 complex, the kinetic analyses presented herein of the inhibition of mutant COX-2s by lumiracoxib allows the definition of the molecular basis of COX-2 inhibition.",

Replacement of NaCl by LiCl or choline chloride abolished transport activity in SHR and WKY PTE cells. In the presence of the system L inhibitor BCH, Na(+)-dependent l-alanine uptake in WKY and SHR PTE cells was inhibited by alanine, serine, and cysteine, which is consistent with amino acid transport through ASCT2. The saturable component of Na(+)-dependent l-alanine transport under V(max) conditions in SHR PTE cells was one-half of that in WKY PTE cells, with similar K(m) values. Differences in magnitude of Na(+)-dependent l-alanine uptake through ASCT2 between WKY and SHR PTE cells correlated positively with differences in ASCT2 protein expression, this being more abundant in WKY PTE cells. Abundance of ASCT2 transcript and protein in kidney cortices of SHR rats was also lower than that in normotensive WKY rats. In conclusion, immortalized SHR and WKY PTE cells take up l-alanine mainly through a high-affinity Na(+)-dependent amino acid transporter, with functional features of ASCT2 transport.

Inhibition of glucagon action may therefore be a potential novel target to reduce hyperglycaemia. Here, we investigated whether chronic treatment with a glucagon receptor antagonist (GRA) improves islet dysfunction in female mice on a high-fat diet (HFD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: After 8 weeks of HFD, mice were treated with a small molecule GRA (300 mg/kg, gavage once daily) for up to 30 days. Insulin secretion was studied after oral and intravenous administration of glucose and glucagon secretion after intravenous arginine. Islet morphology was examined and insulin secretion and glucose oxidation were measured in isolated islets. RESULTS: Fasting plasma glucose levels were reduced by GRA (6.0 +/- 0.2 vs 7.4 +/- 0.5 mmol/l; p = 0.017). The acute insulin response to intravenous glucose was augmented (1,300 +/- 110 vs 790 +/- 64 pmol/l; p < 0.001). The early insulin response to oral glucose was reduced in mice on HFD + GRA (1,890 +/- 160 vs 3,040 +/- 420 pmol/l; p = 0.012), but glucose excursions were improved. Intravenous arginine significantly increased the acute glucagon response (129 +/- 12 vs 36 +/- 6 ng/l in controls; p < 0.01), notably without affecting plasma glucose. GRA caused a modest increase in alpha cell mass, while beta cell mass was similar to that in mice on HFD + vehicle. Isolated islets displayed improved glucose-stimulated insulin secretion after GRA treatment (0.061 +/- 0.007 vs 0.030 +/- 0.004 pmol islet(-1) h(-1) at 16.7 mmol/l glucose; p < 0.001), without affecting islet glucose oxidation. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Chronic glucagon receptor antagonism in HFD-fed mice improves islet sensitivity to glucose and increases insulin secretion, suggesting improvement of key defects underlying impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes.",

We have earlier shown that H(2)S acts as a mediator of inflammation. However the mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the presence of H(2)S and the expression of H(2)S synthesizing enzymes, CSE and CBS, in isolated mouse pancreatic acini. Pancreatic acinar cells from mice were incubated with or without caerulein (10(-7) M for 30 and 60 min). Caerulein increased the levels of H(2)S and CSE mRNA expression while CBS mRNA expression was decreased. In addition, cells pre-treated with DL-propargylglycine (PAG, 3 mM), a CSE inhibitor, reduced the formation of H(2)S in caerulein treated cells, suggesting that CSE may be the main enzyme involved in H(2)S formation in mouse acinar cells. Furthermore, substance P (SP) concentration in the acini and expression of SP gene (preprotachykinin-A, PPT-A) and neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1R), the primary receptor for SP, are increased in secretagogue caerulein-treated acinar cells. Inhibition of endogenous production of H(2)S by PAG significantly suppressed SP concentration, PPT-A expression and NK1-R expression in the acini. To determine whether H(2)S itself provoked inflammation in acinar cells, the cells were treated with H(2)S donor drug, sodium hydrosulphide (NaHS), (10, 50 and 100 muM), that resulted in a significant increase in SP concentration and expression of PPT-A and NK1-R in acinar cells.

In the present study, endothelial cells from equine pulmonary arteries were cultured in the presence of recombinant equine (re) IL-4 and reIL-5, and the cytokine mRNA expression of molecules implicated in the chemotaxis and migration of neutrophils was studied using real-time RT-PCR. The functional response of reIL-4-induced endothelial cell stimulation on neutrophil migration was also studied using a chemotaxis chamber. ReIL-4 either increased the expression of CXCL-8, E-selectin, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), or potentiated the coeffects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) on CXCL-8. Supernatants collected from cultured endothelial cells stimulated with reIL-4 significantly promoted neutrophil migration in a dose-dependent manner. Dexamethasone (DXM) decreased the expression of CXCL-8, VEGF, and iNOS induced by reIL-4, while 1400W dihydrochloride (1400W), a selective inhibitor of iNOS, decreased the expression of E-selectin, VEGF, and iNOS. DXM and 1400W attenuated the mRNA expression of E-selectin and iNOS induced by the costimulation of reIL-4, reTNF-alpha, and LPS. Neither equine nor human recombinant IL-5 influenced the mRNA expression of CXCL-8, E-selectin, or VEGF. These findings suggest that Th2-type cytokines may contribute to pulmonary neutrophilia during allergic inflammation by the increased expression of neutrophil chemokines and adhesion molecules by endothelial cells.

To date, different mutations in genes encoding for cardiac ion channels (KCNH2, KCNQ1, and KCNJ2) have been identified to cause the short QT syndrome. The mutations lead to a gain of function of the affected current (IKr, IKs, and IK1). The phenotype is characterized by a shortened QT interval<335 ms after correction for heart rate at rates<80 beats/min. Furthermore, the QT interval poorly adapts to heart rate. Patients exhibit shortened atrial and ventricular effective refractory periods and, in the majority, inducibility of ventricular fibrillation. Death occurs already in newborns. Therapy of choice seems to be the implantable cardioverter defibrillator because of the high incidence of sudden death. Pharmacological treatment has been studied and it could be demonstrated, that some mutant currents may be insufficiently suppressed by drugs targeted to block the specific current such as, e.g., sotalol or ibutilide in patients with a mutation in the IKr-coding gene KCNH2 (HERG).

The purified gene product catalyzed not only racemization of serine but also dehydration of serine to pyruvate. The enzyme requires PLP and divalent cations such as Ca(2+), Mg(2+), or Mn(2+), but not ATP, whereas mammalian serine racemase activity is increased by ATP.

        "input": "BACKGROUND: CYP2C9 polymorphisms are associated with decreased S-warfarin clearance and lower maintenance dosage. Decreased expression of VKORC1 resulting from the -1639G>A substitution has also been implicated in lower warfarin dose requirements. We investigated the additional contribution of this polymorphism to the variance in warfarin dose. METHODS: Sixty-five patients with stable anticoagulation were genotyped for CYP2C9 and VKORC1 with Tag-It allele-specific primer extension technology. Plasma S-warfarin concentrations and warfarin maintenance dose were compared among patients on the basis of the VKORC1 -1639G>A genotype. RESULTS: Eighty percent of CYP2C9*1/*1 patients stabilized on <4.0 mg/day warfarin had at least 1 VKORC1 -1639A allele. Mean warfarin doses (SD) were 6.7 (3.3), 4.3 (2.2), and 2.7 (1.2) mg/day for patients with the VKORC1 -1639GG, GA, and AA genotypes, respectively. Steady-state plasma concentrations of S-warfarin were lowest in patients with the VKORC1 -1639AA genotype and demonstrated a positive association with the VKORC1 -1639G allele copy number (trend P = 0.012). A model including VKORC1 and CYP2C9 genotypes, age, sex, and body weight accounted for 61% of the variance in warfarin daily maintenance dose. CONCLUSIONS: The VKORC1 -1639A allele accounts for low dosage requirements of most patients without a CYP2C9 variant. Higher plasma S-warfarin concentrations corresponding to increased warfarin maintenance dosages support a hypothesis for increased expression of the VKORC1 -1639G allele. VKORC1 and CYP2C9 genotypes, age, sex, and body weight account for the majority of variance in warfarin dose among our study population.",

        "input": "We show that cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase (cAspAT) is involved in adipocyte glyceroneogenesis, a regulated pathway that controls fatty acid homeostasis by promoting glycerol 3-phosphate formation for fatty acid re-esterification during fasting. cAspAT activity, as well as the incorporation of [(14)C]aspartate into the neutral lipid fraction of 3T3-F442A adipocytes was stimulated by the thiazolidinedione (TZD) rosiglitazone. Conversely, the ratio of fatty acid to glycerol released into the medium decreased. Regulation of cAspAT gene expression was specific to differentiated adipocytes and did not require any peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma)/retinoid X receptor-alpha direct binding. Nevertheless, PPARgamma is indirectly necessary for both cAspAT basal expression and TZD responsiveness because they are, respectively, diminished and abolished by ectopic overexpression of a dominant negative PPARgamma. The cAspAT TZD-responsive site was restricted to a single AGGACA hexanucleotide located at -381 to -376 bp whose mutation impaired the specific RORalpha binding. RORalpha ectopic expression activated the cAspAT gene transcription in absence of rosiglitazone, and its protein amount in nuclear extracts is 1.8-fold increased by rosiglitazone treatment of adipocytes. Finally, the amounts of RORalpha and cAspAT mRNAs were similarly increased by TZD treatment of human adipose tissue explants, confirming coordinated regulation. Our data identify cAspAT as a new member of glyceroneogenesis, transcriptionally regulated by TZD via the control of RORalpha expression by PPARgamma in adipocytes.",

        "input": "4-Hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) is a mutagenic alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde produced during oxidative injury that is conjugated by several glutathione S-transferase (GST) isoforms. The alpha class human GSTA4-4 enzyme (hGSTA4-4) has a particularly high catalytic efficiency toward 4-HNE conjugation. However, hGST4-4 expression is low in most human cells and there are other aldehyde metabolizing enzymes that detoxify 4-HNE. In the current study, we determined the effect of over-expression of hGSTA4 mRNA on the sensitivity of HepG2 cells to 4-HNE injury. HepG2 cells transfected with an hGSTA4 vector construct exhibited high steady-state hGSTA4 mRNA, high GST-4-HNE catalytic activities, but lower basal glutathione (GSH) concentrations relative to insert-free vector (control) cells. Exposure to 4-HNE elicited an increase in GSH concentrations in the control and hGSTA4 cells, although the dose-response of GSH induction differed among the two cell types. Specifically, hGSTA4 cells had significantly higher GSH concentrations when exposed to 5-15 microM 4-HNE, but not at 20 microM 4-HNE, suggesting extensive GSH utilization at high concentrations of 4-HNE. The hGSTA4 cells exhibited a significant growth advantage relative to control cells in the absence of 4-HNE, and a trend towards increased growth at low dose exposures to 4-HNE. However, the hGSTA4 cells did not exhibit a growth advantage relative to control cells at higher 4-HNE exposures associated with increased GSH utilization. As expected, the hGSTA4 cells showed resistance to 4-HNE stimulated lipid peroxidation at all 4-HNE doses. In summary, our data indicates that over-expression of hGSTA4 at levels conferring high GST-4-HNE conjugating activity confers a partial growth advantage to HepG2 cells and protects against 4-HNE oxidative injury. However, the loss of proliferative capacity of hGSTA4 cells challenged with levels of 4-HNE associated with severe oxidative stress indicates a role of other aldehyde metabolizing enzymes, and/or GSH-electrophile transporter proteins, in providing full cellular protection against 4-HNE toxicity.",

        "input": "Throughout the world many people use artificial sweeteners (AS) for the purpose of reducing caloric intake. The most prominently used of these molecules include saccharin, aspartame (Nutrasweet), acesulfame-K, and cyclamate. Despite the caloric advantage they provide, one key concern in their use is their aversive aftertaste that has been characterized on a sensory level as bitter and/or metallic. Recently, it has been shown that the activation of particular T2R bitter taste receptors is partially involved with the bitter aftertaste sensation of saccharin and acesulfame-K. To more fully understand the biology behind these phenomena we have addressed the question of whether AS could stimulate transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) receptors, as these receptors are activated by a large range of structurally different chemicals. Moreover, TRPV1 receptors and/or their variants are found in taste receptor cells and in nerve terminals throughout the oral cavity. Hence, TRPV1 activation could be involved in the AS aftertaste or even contribute to the poorly understood metallic taste sensation. Using Ca(2+) imaging on TRPV1 receptors heterologously expressed in the human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells and on dissociated primary sensory neurons, we find that in both systems, AS activate TRPV1 receptors, and, moreover, they sensitize these channels to acid and heat. We also found that TRPV1 receptors are activated by CuSO(4), ZnSO(4), and FeSO(4), three salts known to produce a metallic taste sensation. In summary, our results identify a novel group of compounds that activate TRPV1 and, consequently, provide a molecular mechanism that may account for off tastes of sweeteners and metallic tasting salts.",

Cardinal) stored at 0 degrees C. In the present work, we analyzed whether total anthocyanin content, the molecular mechanism implicated in their biosynthesis and antioxidant activity is related to the beneficial effect of this gaseous treatment. We isolated partial cDNAs that codified for enzymes implicated in the anthocyanin biosynthesis such as l-phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and chalcone synthase (CHS), and an antioxidant enzyme such as ascorbate peroxidase (APX). Low temperatures induced an accumulation of total anthocyanin content in the skin of both treated and non-treated grapes, although levels were lower in CO2-treated fruit. By contrast, antioxidant activity decreased during storage at 0 degrees C in non-treated grapes but did not change in CO2-treated grapes. The up-regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis gene expression and VcAPX mRNA observed in non-treated grape is not enhanced in CO2-treated grapes, which presented low total decay. These results point out the ability of CO2-treated grapes to prevent the generation of reactive oxygen species rather than their inactivation by means of induction of studied defense systems.",

        "input": "UNLABELLED: Therapeutic interventions that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) have an important role in slowing the progression of cardiovascular risk actors to established cardiovascular diseases. In recent years, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have emerged as effective and well-tolerated alternatives to an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) for RAAS blockade. The ARB candesartan was initially established as an effective once-daily antihypertensive treatment, providing 24-h blood pressure (BP) control with a trough:peak ratio close to 100%. SCOPE: A Medline literature search was undertaken to identify randomised, controlled trials that examined the efficacy and cardiovascular outcomes associated with candesartan cilexetil in hypertension and chronic heart failure (CHF). FINDINGS: Compared with other ARBs, candesartan demonstrates the strongest binding affinity to the angiotensin II type 1 receptor. Clinical trials have demonstrated that candesartan is well tolerated in combination with diuretics or calcium channel blockers (CCBs), making it a suitable treatment option for patients whose hypertension is not adequately controlled by monotherapy. Subsequently, candesartan became the only ARB licensed in the UK to treat patients with CHF and left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 40% as add-on therapy to an ACEi or when an ACEi is not tolerated. Studies in patients with symptomatic HF have indicated that candesartan treatment was associated with significant relative risk reductions in cardiovascular mortality and hospitalisation due to CHF. CONCLUSIONS: There are clear indications that the clinical benefits of candesartan may extend beyond its proven antihypertensive effects to a wider range of complications across the cardiovascular continuum, including diabetes, left ventricular hypertrophy, atherosclerosis and stroke. Such results suggest that candesartan treatment may offer significant patient benefits as well as practical advantages over conventional treatment.",

        "input": "In this study, we investigated the alterations of the redox balance induced by the lipid fraction of oxLDL in Caco-2 intestinal cells, and the effects of tyrosol and protocatechuic acid, two dietary phenolic compounds. We found that oxidized lipids extracted from oxLDL (LipE) induced oxidative stress by determining, 6 h after treatment, ROS overproduction (about a 100% and a 43% increase of O*2 and H2O2 production, respectively, P<.05: LipE vs. control) and, 12 h after treatment, GSH depletion (about a 26% decrease, P<.05: LipE vs. control), and by impairing the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase. In response to the induced oxidative stress, we observed significant overexpression of glutathione peroxidase (6 h after treatment: P<.05), glutathione reductase and gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (12 h after treatment: P<.05). Notably, when GSH depletion occurred, p66Shc protein expression increased by about 300% with respect to control (P<.001; LipE vs. control). These effects were fully counteracted by dietary phenolics which inhibited ROS overproduction and GSH consumption, rendered the reactive transcription of glutathione-associated enzymes unnecessary and blocked the intracellular signals leading to the overexpression and rearrangement of p66Shc signalling molecule. Altogether, these results suggest that the impairment of the antioxidant system hijacks intestinal cells towards an apoptotic-prone phenotype via the activation of p66Shc molecule. They also propose a reappraisal of dietary polyphenols as intestinal protecting agents, indicating the antiapoptotic effect as a further mechanism of action of these antioxidant compounds.",

        "input": "AIM: To assess the efficacy and safety of a 24-week treatment with sitagliptin, a highly selective once-daily oral dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, in patients with type 2 diabetes who had inadequate glycaemic control [glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) >or=7.5% and <or=10.5%] while on glimepiride alone or in combination with metformin. METHODS: After a screening, diet/exercise run-in and drug wash-off period, a glimepiride +/- metformin dose titration/stabilization period and a 2-week, single-blind placebo run-in, 441 patients (of ages 18-75 years) were randomized to receive the addition of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily or placebo in a 1 : 1 ratio for 24 weeks. Of these patients, 212 were on glimepiride (>or=4 mg/day) monotherapy and 229 were on glimepiride (>or=4 mg/day) plus metformin (>or=1,500 mg/day) combination therapy. Patients exceeding pre-specified glycaemic thresholds during the double-blind treatment period were provided open-label rescue therapy (pioglitazone) until study end. The primary efficacy analysis evaluated the change in HbA(1c) from baseline to Week 24. Secondary efficacy endpoints included fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-h post-meal glucose and lipid measurements. RESULTS: Mean baseline HbA(1c) was 8.34% in the sitagliptin and placebo groups. After 24 weeks, sitagliptin reduced HbA(1c) by 0.74% (p < 0.001) relative to placebo. In the subset of patients on glimepiride plus metformin, sitagliptin reduced HbA(1c) by 0.89% relative to placebo, compared with a reduction of 0.57% in the subset of patients on glimepiride alone. The addition of sitagliptin reduced FPG by 20.1 mg/dl (p < 0.001) and increased homeostasis model assessment-beta, a marker of beta-cell function, by 12% (p < 0.05) relative to placebo. In patients who underwent a meal tolerance test (n = 134), sitagliptin decreased 2-h post-prandial glucose (PPG) by 36.1 mg/dl (p < 0.001) relative to placebo. The addition of sitagliptin was generally well tolerated, although there was a higher incidence of overall (60 vs. 47%) and drug-related adverse experiences (AEs) (15 vs. 7%) in the sitagliptin group than in the placebo group. This was largely because of a higher incidence of hypoglycaemia AEs (12 vs. 2%, respectively) in the sitagliptin group compared with the placebo group. Body weight modestly increased with sitagliptin relative to placebo (+0.8 vs. -0.4 kg; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Sitagliptin 100 mg once daily significantly improved glycaemic control and beta-cell function in patients with type 2 diabetes who had inadequate glycaemic control with glimepiride or glimepiride plus metformin therapy. The addition of sitagliptin was generally well tolerated, with a modest increase in hypoglycaemia and body weight, consistent with glimepiride therapy and the observed degree of glycaemic improvement.",

        "input": "Individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) are highly susceptible to infection. This post-traumatic immune suppression is thought to occur via alterations in sympathetic nervous system (SNS) or hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function. Normally, the HPA axis and SNS help coordinate proper immune function. After SCI, the HPA axis becomes activated and descending input to sympathetic preganglionic neurons (SPNs) is impaired. Because lymphoid organs are innervated by SPNs distributed throughout the thoracolumbar spinal cord, we predicted level-dependent immune suppression after SCI due to activation of the HPA axis and loss of descending input to SPNs. We tested this hypothesis by measuring indices of HPA (circulating corticosterone; CORT) and SNS function (norepinephrine (NE) in spleen) as well as antigen-specific antibody synthesis against an exogenous non-self protein following high- or low-level SCI. Using a mid-thoracic (T9) spinal contusion injury model, we found that CORT was elevated after SCI with aberrant patterns of diurnal CORT synthesis evident through at least the first 24 h post-injury. However, splenic NE and antibody synthesis were similar to uninjured controls. Injury severity did not change these parameters. Indeed, CORT, NE and antibody synthesis were similar after T9 contusion or transection SCI. In contrast, high-level SCI (T3) caused sustained increases in CORT and splenic NE along with impaired antibody synthesis and elevated splenocyte apoptosis. The immunosuppressive effects of T3 SCI were caused by NE acting at beta2-adrenergic receptors (beta2AR) and could be reversed using beta2AR blockers. Interestingly, impaired antibody after T3 SCI could be mimicked after T9 SCI with a beta2AR agonist. These data illustrate the immunosuppressive effects of the SNS after high-level SCI and indicate that immune deficits may be overcome using beta-blockers.",

        "input": "Niemann-Pick disease type C (NP-C) is a lipid storage disorder characterized by the accumulation of unesterified cholesterol and glycolipids in the lysosomal/late endosomal system of certain cells in the central nervous system (CNS) and visceral organs. Clinical symptoms include progressive neurological deterioration and visceral organomegaly. Miglustat, a small iminosugar molecule approved for the treatment of Gaucher disease, reversibly inhibits glucosylceramide synthase, which catalyses the first committed step in glycosphingolipid synthesis. The physicochemical properties of miglustat allow it to cross the blood-brain barrier and suggest possible benefits in lysosomal storage diseases affecting the CNS. Here, we present findings in two children with NP-C, aged 14 years (patient 1) and 9 years (patient 2), treated with miglustat for 1 year. Before treatment, patient 1 presented with severe difficulties in swallowing and walking, and patient 2 with problems mostly affecting communication and social interaction. Videofluoroscopic studies in patient 1 demonstrated a substantial improvement in swallowing by month 6 of treatment, and ambulation index measurements indicated improved walking. Mini Mental-State Examination (MMSE) assessments in patient 2 showed cognitive improvement by month 6, which was sustained up to month 12. Liver/spleen volume and plasma chitotriosidase activities were stabilized in both cases. There was no weight loss during treatment. Patient 1 experienced severe but self-limiting paresthesia, which was not associated with peripheral neuropathy.

To mimic clinical Ritalin treatment in children, male rats were injected with MPH (5 mg/kg) or vehicle twice daily from postnatal day 7 (PND7)-PND35. At the end of administration (PND35) or in adulthood (PND135), brain sections from littermate pairs were immunocytochemically labeled for neurotransmitters and cytological markers in 16 regions implicated in MPH effects and/or ADHD etiology. At PND35, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of rats given MPH showed 55% greater immunoreactivity (-ir) for the catecholamine marker tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), 60% more Nissl-stained cells, and 40% less norepinephrine transporter (NET)-ir density. In hippocampal dentate gyrus, MPH-receiving rats showed a 51% decrease in NET-ir density and a 61% expanded distribution of the new-cell marker PSA-NCAM (polysialylated form of neural cell adhesion molecule). In medial striatum, TH-ir decreased by 21%, and in hypothalamus neuropeptide Y-ir increased by 10% in MPH-exposed rats. At PND135, MPH-exposed rats exhibited decreased anxiety in the elevated plus-maze and a trend for decreased TH-ir in the mPFC.

In the smooth muscle, relative mRNA expression levels for alpha(1a)-, alpha(1b)- and alpha(1d)-adrenoceptors were 10.7%, 1.2% and 88.1%, respectively, and protein expressions were identified for alpha(1A)- and alpha(1D)-adrenoceptors immunohistochemically.

        "input": "Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), a tryptophan catabolizing enzyme, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various neurological disorders. IDO expression is induced by IFN-gamma and leads to neurotoxicity by generating quinolinic acid. Additionally, it inhibits the immune response through both tryptophan depletion and generating other tryptophan catabolites. IL-4 and IL-13 have been shown to control IDO expression by antagonizing the effects of IFN-gamma in different cell types. Here, we investigated the effects of these cytokines on IDO expression in microglia. Interestingly, we observed that both IL-4 and IL-13 greatly enhanced IFN-gamma-induced IDO expression. However, tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (WRS), which is coinduced with IDO by IFN-gamma, is downregulated by IL-4 and IL-13. The effect of IL-4 and IL-13 was independent of STAT-6. Modulation of IDO but not WRS was eliminated by inhibition of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway further differentiated the regulation of these two enzymes, as inhibiting the PI3K pathway eliminated IFN-gamma induction of IDO, whereas such inhibition greatly enhanced WRS expression. These findings show discordance between modulations of expression of two distinct enzymes utilizing tryptophan as a common substrate, and raise the possibility of their involvement in regulating immune responses in various neurological disorders.",

        "input": "OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine whether cocaine's sympathomimetic actions can be reversed by a potent centrally acting alpha2 adrenergic receptor (AR) agonist (dexmedetomidine). BACKGROUND: We recently showed that cocaine stimulates the human cardiovascular system primarily by acting in the brain to increase sympathetic nerve activity (SNA), the neural stimulus to norepinephrine release. Thus, SNA constitutes a putative new drug target to block cocaine's adverse cardiovascular effects at their origin. METHODS: In 22 healthy cocaine-naive humans, we measured skin SNA (microneurography) and skin blood flow (laser Doppler velocimetry) as well as heart rate and blood pressure before and after intranasal cocaine (2 mg/kg) alone and in combination with dexmedetomidine or saline. RESULTS: During intranasal cocaine alone, SNA increased by 2-fold and skin vascular resistance increased from 13.2 +/- 2.3 to 20.1 +/- 2.2 resistance units while mean arterial pressure increased by 14 +/- 3 mm Hg and heart rate by 18 +/- 3 beats/min (p < 0.01). Dexmedetomidine abolished these increases, whereas intravenous saline was without effect. Dexmedetomidine was effective in blocking these sympathomimetic actions of cocaine even in all 7 subjects who were homozygous for the Del322-325 polymorphism in the alpha2C AR, a loss-of-function mutation that is highly enriched in blacks. CONCLUSIONS: The data advance the novel hypothesis that central sympatholysis with dexmedetomidine constitutes a highly effective countermeasure for cocaine's sympathomimetic actions on the human cardiovascular system, even in individuals carrying the alpha2CDel322-325 polymorphism.

Meanwhile, attempts to explain its action by inhibition of a central cyclooxygenase (COX)-3 have been rejected. The fact that acetaminophen acts functionally as a selective COX-2 inhibitor led us to investigate the hypothesis of whether it works via preferential COX-2 blockade. Ex vivo COX inhibition and pharmacokinetics of acetaminophen were assessed in 5 volunteers receiving single 1000 mg doses orally. Coagulation-induced thromboxane B(2) and lipopolysaccharide-induced prostaglandin E(2) were measured ex vivo and in vitro in human whole blood as indices of COX-1 and COX-2 activity. In vitro, acetaminophen elicited a 4.4-fold selectivity toward COX-2 inhibition (IC(50)=113.7 micromol/L for COX-1; IC(50)=25.8 micromol/L for COX-2). Following oral administration of the drug, maximal ex vivo inhibitions were 56% (COX-1) and 83% (COX-2). Acetaminophen plasma concentrations remained above the in vitro IC(50) for COX-2 for at least 5 h postadministration. Ex vivo IC(50) values (COX-1: 105.2 micromol/L; COX-2: 26.3 micromol/L) of acetaminophen compared favorably with its in vitro IC(50) values. In contrast to previous concepts, acetaminophen inhibited COX-2 by more than 80%, i.e., to a degree comparable to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and selective COX-2 inhibitors. However, a >95% COX-1 blockade relevant for suppression of platelet function was not achieved. Our data may explain acetaminophen's analgesic and antiinflammatory action as well as its superior overall gastrointestinal safety profile compared with NSAIDs. In view of its substantial COX-2 inhibition, recently defined cardiovascular warnings for use of COX-2 inhibitors should also be considered for acetaminophen.",

There are three mammalian NCX isoforms: NCX1 is widely expressed in the heart, kidney, brain, blood vessels, and so on; whereas the expression of NCX2 and NCX3 is limited mainly to the brain and skeletal muscle. The pharmacology of NCX inhibitors has been studied extensively since the development of KB-R7943, a prototype benzyloxyphenyl NCX inhibitor, in 1996. Currently, experiments are actively progressing with more selective inhibitors: SEA0400, SN-6, and YM-244769. Intriguingly, the inhibitory potency of benzyloxyphenyl NCX inhibitors is directly coupled to the rate of Na(+)(i)-dependent inactivation. Therefore, the benzyloxyphenyl inhibitors are apparently dormant during the forward mode under normal conditions (low Na(+)(i)), but become effective during the reverse mode under pathological conditions (high Na(+)(i)). This should be an ideal profile for calcium regulators against Na(+)(i)-related diseases, such as ischemia/reperfusion injuries, salt-dependent hypertension, and digitalis arrhythmia. Existing ion channel blockers, such as amiodarone, dronedarone, bepridil, aprindine, and cibenzoline, have been found to have an NCX inhibitory action. It is possible that this property is partly responsible for their antiarrhythmic and cardioprotective effects.

The actions of AVP are mediated by three receptor subtypes V1a, V2, and V1b. The V1a receptor regulates vasodilation and cellular hypertrophy while the V2 receptor regulates free water excretion. The V1b receptor regulates adrenocorticotropin hormone release. Conivaptan is a nonpeptide dual V1a/V2 AVP receptor antagonist. It binds with high affinity, competitively, and reversibly to the V1a/V2 receptor subtypes; its antagonistic effect is concentration dependent. It inhibits CYP3A4 liver enzyme and elevates plasma levels of other drugs metabolized by this enzyme. It is approved only for short-term intravenous use. Infusion site reaction is the most common reason for discontinuation of the drug. In animals conivaptan increased urine volume and free water clearance. In heart failure models it improved hemodynamic parameters and free water excretion. Conivaptan has been shown to correct hyponatremia in euvolemic or hypervolemic patients. Its efficacy and safety for short-term use have led to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of its intravenous form for the correction of hyponatremia in euvolemic and hypervolemic states. Despite its ability to block the action of AVP on V1a receptors, no demonstrable benefit from this action was noted in patients with chronic compensated heart failure and it is not approved for this indication. Consideration should be given to further evaluation of its potential benefits in patients with acute decompensated heart failure.",

AdSS from the thermophilic archaea, Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (MjAdSS) is 345 amino acids long against an average length of 430-457 amino acids for most mesophilic AdSS. This short AdSS has two large deletions that map to the middle and C-terminus of the protein. This article discusses the detailed kinetic characterization of MjAdSS. Initial velocity and product inhibition studies, carried out at 70 degrees C, suggest a rapid equilibrium random AB steady-state ordered C kinetic mechanism for the MjAdSS catalyzed reaction. AdSS are known to exhibit monomer-dimer equilibrium with the dimer being implicated in catalysis. In contrast, our studies show that MjAdSS is an equilibrium mixture of dimers and tetramers with the tetramer being the catalytically active form. The tetramer dissociates into dimers with a minor increase in ionic strength of the buffer, while the dimer is extremely stable and does not dissociate even at 1.2 M NaCl. Phosphate, a product of the reaction, was found to be a potent inhibitor of MjAdSS showing biphasic inhibition of enzyme activity. The inhibition was competitive with IMP and noncompetitive with GTP. MjAdSS, like the mouse acidic isozyme, exhibits substrate inhibition, with IMP inhibiting enzyme activity at subsaturating GTP concentrations. Regulation of enzyme activity by the glycolytic intermediate, fructose 1,6 bisphosphate, was also observed with the inhibition being competitive with IMP and noncompetitive against GTP.",

Cocrystal structures of PDE5 catalytic (C) domain with inhibitors reveal a hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions with Tyr-612, hydrogen bonds with Gln-817, a hydrophobic clamp formed by Phe-820 and Val-782, and contacts with His-613, Leu-765, and Phe-786 [Sung et al. (2003) Nature 425, 98-102; Huai et al. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 13095-13101]. Present results of point mutations of full-length PDE5 showed that maximum catalysis was decreased 2650-fold in H613A and 55-fold in F820A. Catalytic-site affinities for cGMP, vardenafil, sildenafil, tadalafil, or 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) were respectively weakened 14-, 123-, 30-, 51-, and 43-fold for Y612A; 63-, 511-, 43-, 95- and 61-fold for Q817A; and 59-, 448-, 71-, 137-, and 93-fold for F820A. The data indicate that these three amino acids are major determinants of affinity for cGMP and potency of selective and nonselective inhibitors, and that higher vardenafil potency over sildenafil and tadalafil results from stronger contacts with Tyr-612, Gln-817, and Phe-820. Affinity of V782A for cGMP, vardenafil, sildenafil, tadalafil, or IBMX was reduced 5.5-, 23-, 10-, 3-, and 12-fold, respectively.

Beneficially, this relationship allows small decreases in blood pressure to be associated with risk reduction. Both the renin-angiotensin system and the sympathetic nervous system are involved in hypertension, hence targeting these systems is likely to be of benefit in the treatment of hypertension. Angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) are used for controlling blood pressure and treating heart failure in a broad range of patients, including those with diabetes and the elderly. Not only have ARBs shown good efficacy and tolerability, they also appear to have a protective effect that goes beyond that expected from the reduction of blood pressure. The ARB eprosartan is a nonbiphenyl nontetrazole angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) antagonist, which acts to decrease total peripheral resistance. Eprosartan acts at vascular AT1 receptors (postsynaptically) and at presynaptic AT1 receptors, where it inhibits noradrenaline release. In clinical studies, eprosartan has been shown to significantly reduce cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, whilst avoiding the persistent cough that commonly occurs with the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Eprosartan can also be differentiated from other ARBs due to its noradrenergic effects, which other ARBs used at therapeutic doses do not possess. Eprosartan, therefore, represents a useful therapeutic option in the management of patients with hypertension, including those with a history of stroke or with co-morbid type 2 diabetes mellitus.",

One described mechanism leading to the impaired clearance of these cells from the lung is the delay in their programmed cell death (apoptosis). Selective inhibitors of phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are under development for the treatment of lung diseases because of their anti-inflammatory and bronchodilator activity. The aim of the present study was to establish whether inhibitors of PDE3, PDE4 and PDE5 modulate human eosinophil or neutrophil apoptosis or beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist- or cytokine-afforded survival. We also evaluated whether a PDE4 inhibitor could modulate the effect of a corticosteroid on eosinophil and neutrophil apoptosis. Apoptosis was measured by using the relative DNA fragmentation assay and Annexin-V binding. Inhibitors of PDE4 (rolipram; 0.1-10 microM) and PDE3 (cilostazol; 0.1-10 microM) delayed spontaneous eosinophil apoptosis maximally by 25% and 15%, respectively. A combination of a PDE4 or PDE3 inhibitor (10 microM) with salbutamol (100 nM) further delayed eosinophil apoptosis maximally by 42-49%. In neutrophils, rolipram (10 microM) also decreased apoptosis with a maximal inhibition of 13%. The combination of rolipram (10 microM) and salbutamol (100 nM) produced a 27% inhibition of neutrophil apoptosis. Inhibitor of cGMP-specific PDE5 (zaprinast; 0.1-10 microM) did not affect eosinophil apoptosis and only slightly increased spontaneous neutrophil apoptosis. The effect of budesonide on apoptosis was not significantly modulated by a PDE4 inhibitor in eosinophils or neutrophils. The present results show that selective inhibitors of cAMP-hydrolyzing PDEs (PDE3 and PDE4) delay eosinophil apoptosis and, thus, increase their survival in vitro. Furthermore, beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists enhance the anti-apoptotic effects of PDE3 and PDE4 inhibitors, suggesting that such drug combinations may prolong eosinophil and neutrophil longevity in the lung.",

Recently, they are reported to have beneficial effects on certain cancers. In this study, we show that statins inhibited the histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity and increased the accumulation of acetylated histone-H3 and the expression of p21(WAF/CIP) in human cancer cells. Computational modeling showed the direct interaction of the carboxylic acid moiety of statins with the catalytic site of HDAC2. In the subsequent enzymatic assay, it was shown that lovastatin inhibited HDAC2 activity competitively with a K(i) value of 31.6 micromol/L. Sp1 but not p53 sites were found to be the statins-responsive element shown by p21 luciferase-promoter assays. DNA affinity protein binding assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed the dissociation of HDAC1/2 and association of CBP, leading to the histone-H3 acetylation on the Sp1 sites of p21 promoter. In vitro cell proliferation and in vivo tumor growth were both inhibited by statins. These results suggest a novel mechanism for statins through abrogation of the HDAC activity and promoter histone-H3 acetylation to regulate p21 expression. Therefore, statins might serve as novel HDAC inhibitors for cancer therapy and chemoprevention.",

Flavopiridol, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, arrests cell division and causes apoptosis in non-small lung cancer cells [283660]. A phase II trial, in collaboration with the National Cancer Institute, has commenced at the University of Chicago Medical Center, which involves patients with high or intermediate-grade lymphoma or multiple myeloma [272937], [277372]. In ex vivo experiments with tumor cells from refractory chronic lymphoblastic leukemia, dose-dependent CDK2 inhibition associated with apoptotic changes was seen at concentrations greater than 100 nM of flavopiridol. In vitro pharmacokinetic studies have shown that flavopiridol undergoes hepatic biotransformation to its corresponding glucoronide by uridine diphosphate glucoronosyltransferases [283791]. Flavopiridol inhibits CDK with an IC50 value of 0.4 mM [285707]. Preclinical toxicology studies in rats and dogs demonstrated dose-related leukopenia and drug-related lesions in the thymus, spleen and bone marrow. The gastrointestinal and bone marrow toxicity was dose-limiting [178579]. Hoechst Marion Roussel expects to launch flavopiridol in the year 2001, with potential sales in excess of DM 750 million [288651].",

By combining the most favorable substitutions we increased the binding affinity of paclitaxel 500-fold. Insight into the structural basis for this improvement was gained with molecular modeling and NMR data obtained for microtubule-bound docetaxel. Taxanes with affinities for microtubules well above their affinities for P-glycoprotein are shown not to be affected by multidrug resistance.

Its antipsychotic effect is assumed to be related to the active moiety, that is, the sum of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone. Both risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone are substrates of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a transport protein involved in drug absorption, distribution, and elimination. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of polymorphisms in genes encoding CYP3A5 and P-gp (ABCB1) on the steady-state plasma levels of risperidone, 9-hydroxyrisperidone, and the active moiety, taking CYP2D6 genotype status into account. Forty-six white patients with schizophrenia treated with risperidone (1-10 mg/d) in monotherapy for 4-6 weeks were genotyped, and their plasma concentrations of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone were measured. Dose-corrected plasma concentrations (C/D) of risperidone, 9-hydroxyrisperidone, and active moiety showed up to 68-, 9-, and 10-fold interindividual variation, respectively. Six patients carried 1 CYP3A5*1 allele and therefore were likely to express the CYP3A5 enzyme. The CYP3A5 genotype did not influence risperidone, 9-hydroxyrisperidone, or active moiety C/Ds. The CYP2D6 genotype in these 46 patients was again associated with risperidone C/D (P = 0.001) but not with 9-hydroxyrisperidone C/D or active moiety C/D, as previously shown by our group in 37 of these patients. Patients homozygous for the ABCB1 3435T/2677T/1236T haplotype had significantly lower C/Ds of 9-hydroxyrisperidone (P = 0.026) and active moiety (P = 0.028) than patients carrying other ABCB1 genotypes. In conclusion, our results confirmed the significant effect of CYP2D6 genotype on the steady-state plasma levels of risperidone and showed that ABCB1 polymorphisms have a moderate effect on those of 9-hydroxyrisperidone and the active moiety.",

PGE(2) is synthesized from arachidonic acid by cyclooxygenases (COX) and prostaglandin E synthases (PGES) and mediates its biological activity through binding to the four prostanoid receptors EP(1) through EP(4). In this study, we show for the first time that medulloblastoma (MB), the most common malignant childhood brain tumor, expresses high levels of COX-2, microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1, and EP(1) through EP(4) and secretes PGE(2). PGE(2) and the EP(2) receptor agonist butaprost stimulated MB cell proliferation. Treatment of MB cells with COX inhibitors suppressed PGE(2) production and induced caspase-dependent apoptosis. Similarly, specific COX-2 silencing by small interfering RNA inhibited MB cell growth. EP(1) and EP(3) receptor antagonists ONO-8713 and ONO-AE3-240, but not the EP(4) antagonists ONO-AE3-208 and AH 23848, inhibited tumor cell proliferation, indicating the significance of EP(1) and EP(3) but not EP(4) for MB growth. Administration of COX inhibitors at clinically achievable nontoxic concentrations significantly inhibited growth of established human MB xenografts. Apoptosis was increased, proliferation was reduced, and angiogenesis was inhibited in MBs treated with COX inhibitors.

In many countries, a mu-opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone has been used in the treatment of alcohol dependence. The introduction of naltrexone for the treatment of alcohol dependence has been mainly based on behavioral animal models that provide evidence of the involvement of the endogenous opioid system in alcohol drinking and dependence. It has been well known that alcohol leads to the activation of the endogenous opioid system. The endogenous opioid agonists, such as beta-endorphin, increase the activity of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system through the inhibition of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-containing inhibitory interneurons in the ventral tegmental area, resulting in the expression of alcohol reinforcement and/or rewarding effect. Therefore, naltrexone, which is useful for alcohol dependence therapy, may attenuate the rewarding effect of ethanol by interfering with the ethanol-induced stimulation of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system. The following review provides a summary of the interactions between endogenous opioid system and mesolimbic dopaminergic system in alcohol dependence.",

METHODS: Male rats were administered PLZ (10 mg/kg) or VIG (1,000 mg/kg) i.p., and the rats were euthanized 4 hours later and the brains removed for analysis of levels of GABA and ALA (by electron capture gas chromatography after derivatization) and activities of MAO, GABA-T and ALA-T (radiochemical assays). RESULTS: Both PLZ and VIG inhibited GABA-T and elevated GABA levels. Only PLZ inhibited MAO and ALA-T and elevated ALA levels. The effects of PLZ on both amino acids and their transaminases were blocked by pre-treatment with the MAO inhibitor tranylcypromine. This pretreament had no effect on the inhibition of GABA-T or the elevation of brain GABA levels produced by VIG. CONCLUSIONS: At the doses studied, PLZ was as effective as VIG at elevating brain GABA levels, but, unlike VIG, also inhibited MAO and ALA-T (and increased brain ALA levels). Pretreatment of rats with the MAO inhibitor tranylcypromine prevented the increase in brain GABA and ALA levels with PLZ, but did not block the effect of VIG on GABA. These observations with tranylcypromine and PLZ support the hypothesis that an active metabolite of PLZ produced by the actions of MAO on this drug plays a major role in its GABA- and ALA-elevating actions.",

In the present study, we report that SoRI-9804 and SoRI-20040, at doses that do not alter release, partially inhibited d-amphetamine-induced DAT-mediated release of [(3)H]1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+))or[(3)H]dopamine from striatal synaptosomes (\"DAT-mediated DA release\") in a dose-dependent manner. SoRI-20041, which does not alter DAT-mediated DA release measured with [(3)H]DA, reversed the effect of SoRI-20040. SoRI-20040 and SoRI-9804 also partially inhibited DAT-mediated DA release induced by DA or (+/-)-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine, demonstrating that the observed partial inhibition is not specific for a particular DAT substrate.

It appears to be safe and effective at promoting aquaresis and raising serum sodium levels in both short- and long-term studies. Tolvaptan is also effective for treatment of congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation, but whether there are long standing beneficial effects on CHF is still controversial. Prolonged use of tolvaptan leads to increased endogenous levels of AVP and perhaps over-stimulation of V(1A) receptors. Theoretically this activation could lead to increased afterload and cardiac myocyte fibrosis, causing progression of CHF. However, after 52 weeks of tolvaptan therapy there was no worsening of left ventricular dilatation. In addition, tolvaptan is metabolized by the CYP3A4 system; thus physicians should be aware of the potential for increased interactions with other medications.

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the commonest cause of dementia affecting older people. One of the therapeutic strategies aimed at ameliorating the clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease is to enhance cholinergic neurotransmission in relevant parts of the brain by the use of cholinesterase inhibitors to delay the breakdown of acetylcholine released into synaptic clefts. Tacrine, the first of the cholinesterase inhibitors to undergo extensive trials for this purpose, was associated with significant adverse effects including hepatotoxicity. Other cholinesterase inhibitors, including rivastigmine, with superior properties in terms of specificity of action and low risk of adverse effects, have now been introduced. Rivastigmine has received approval for use in 60 countries including all member states of the European Union and the USA. OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical efficacy and safety of rivastigmine for patients with dementia of Alzheimer's type. SEARCH STRATEGY: The Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG), The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS were searched on 27 March 2008 using the terms: Rivastigmine OR exelon OR ENA OR \"SDZ ENA 713\" . The CDCIG Specialized Register contains records from all major health care databases (The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS) as well as from many clinical trials registries and grey literature sources. SELECTION CRITERIA: All unconfounded, double-blind, randomized trials in which treatment with rivastigmine was administered to patients with dementia of the Alzheimer's type for more than two weeks and its effects compared with those of placebo in a parallel group of patients. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: One reviewer (JSB) applied study selection criteria, assessed the quality of studies and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: Nine trials, involving 4775 participants, were included in the analyses. Use of rivastigmine in high doses was associated with statistically significant benefits on several measures. High-dose rivastigmine (6 to 12 mg daily) was associated with a two-point improvement in cognitive function on the ADAS-Cog score compared with placebo (weighted mean difference -1.99, 95% confidence interval -2.49 to -1.50, on an intention-to-treat basis) and a 2.2 point improvement in activities of daily living assessed on the Progressive Deterioration Scale (weighted mean difference -2.15, 95% confidence interval -3.16 to -1.13, on an intention-to-treat basis) at 26 weeks. At lower doses (4 mg daily or lower) differences were in the same direction but were statistically significant only for cognitive function. There were statistically significantly higher numbers of events of nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, anorexia, headache, syncope, abdominal pain and dizziness among patients taking high-dose rivastigmine than among those taking placebo. There was some evidence that adverse events might be less common with more frequent, smaller doses of rivastigmine. The 2008 update includes a new study testing two types of rivastigmine transdermal patch, one delivering a higher dose than previously tested (17.4 mg/day) and a smaller patch delivering 9.6 mg/day. The efficacy of the smaller patch was not significantly different compared with the capsules of similar daily dose, but was associated with significantly fewer adverse events of nausea, vomiting, dizziness and asthenia. The efficacy of the larger patch was not significantly different compared with the smaller patch, but the smaller patch was associated with significantly fewer adverse events of nausea, vomiting, weight loss and dizziness. There appears to be advantages associated with the smaller patch compared with both the higher dose patch and the 6-12 mg/day capsules. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Rivastigmine appears to be beneficial for people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. In comparisons with placebo, improvements were seen in the rate of decline of cognitive function, activities of daily living, and severity of dementia with daily doses of 6 to 12 mg. Adverse events were consistent with the cholinergic actions of the drug. A transdermal patch has been tested in one trial, and there is evidence that the lower dose smaller patch is associated with fewer side effects than the capsules or the higher dose larger patch and has comparable efficacy to both.

The potential for ketoconazole, the archetypal strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, to alter the pharmacokinetic profile of ambrisentan and its oxidative metabolite, 4-hydroxymethyl ambrisentan, was assessed in an open-label, nonrandomized, 2-period, single-sequence study in 16 healthy men. Participants received a single dose of ambrisentan 10 mg alone and after 4 days of ketoconazole 400 mg administered once daily. In the presence of multiple doses of ketoconazole, single-dose ambrisentan AUC(0-infinity) estimate was increased by 35.3%, whereas C(max) was increased by 20.0%. For the 4-hydroxymethyl ambrisentan metabolite, AUC(0-infinity) estimate was decreased by 4.0%, whereas C(max) was decreased by 16.5%. Concomitant administration of ambrisentan and ketoconazole was well tolerated. In summary, ketoconazole had no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics or safety profile of ambrisentan; therefore, no changes in ambrisentan dose should be necessary when the drug is administered concomitantly with known CYP3A4 inhibitors.",

However, the mechanisms underlying hepatic alpha-tocopherol secretion are not fully understood. This study was undertaken to elucidate the mechanism of alpha-tocopherol re-efflux from hepatocytes, the cells that have the most important role in regulating plasma-alpha-tocopherol concentrations. From in vitro experiments using [(3)H]alpha-tocopheryl acetate and McARH7777 cells that stably express alpha-tocopherol transfer protein (alpha-TTP), the following results were obtained. First, addition of apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), a direct acceptor of the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1)-secreted lipids, increased alpha-tocopherol secretion in a dose-dependent manner. Second, probucol, an antiatherogenic compound reported to be an inactivator of ABCA1 reduced hepatic alpha-tocopherol secretion. Third, ABCA1-RNAi suppressed hepatic alpha-tocopherol secretion. In a mouse in vivo experiment, addition of 1% probucol to the diet decreased plasma alpha-tocopherol concentrations. These results strongly suggest that ABCA1 is substantially involved in hepatic alpha-tocopherol secretion.",

        "input": "INTRODUCTION: In this study, we examined the effects of the alpha-glucosidase inhibitors acarbose and voglibose on postprandial plasma glucose and serum triglyceride levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. METHODS: Twenty-one Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes were enrolled in this study. Subjects had been treated with voglibose for at least 3 months. They underwent a 400 kcal balanced food meal tolerance test before and 8 weeks after the changeover from voglibose to acarbose. Subjects were divided into two groups: the first group (low-dose group; n=11) was changed over from 0.6 mg/day voglibose to 150 mg/day acarbose, and the other (high-dose group; n=10) from 0.9 mg/day voglibose to 300 mg/day acarbose. RESULTS: The increment rate of postprandial plasma glucose ([plasma glucose 2 hours after test meal - fasting glucose]/fasting glucose) decreased from 34.7%+/-23.9% to 25.0%+/-24.6% (P=0.13) in the low-dose group, and decreased significantly from 56.1%+/-53.1% to 31.5%+/-36.0% (P=0.03) in the high-dose group after changeover. However, there were no significant changes in blood glycated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) levels before and after changeover in either group. The increment rate of postprandial serum triglyceride (TG) ([serum TG 2 hours after test meal - fasting TG]/fasting TG) decreased significantly only in the high-dose group (52.4%+/-60.0% to 24.3%+/-16.6%) (P=0.05). No significant changes in serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were observed in either group, whereas serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels decreased significantly from 3.20+/-0.25 to 2.65+/-0.18 mmol/L (P=0.04), only in the high-dose group. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with type 2 diabetes our findings suggest that acarbose 300 mg/day is superior to voglibose 0.9 mg/day in improving postprandial hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia.",

Kinases, including IKKbeta, JNK, ERK, mTOR, and S6K, activated by the inducers of insulin resistance induce uncontrolled IRS serine phosphorylation. Studies with genetically modified mice reveal that these kinases integrate signals from metabolic and inflammatory stresses in adipose tissue, liver, and hypothalamus leading to peripheral and central insulin resistance. Moreover, IKKbeta/NF-kappaB and JNK1 pathways in myeloid cells represent a core mechanism involved in inflammation linked to obesity. These kinases are thus potential drug targets against insulin resistance and the targeting of the IKKbeta/NF-kappaB or the JNK pathway may evolve into future diabetes medication.",

Each patient acted as his or her own control (total number of ECT procedures, 160). We administered a 4-min infusion of either placebo or esmolol at the rate of 500 micrograms.kg-1.min-1. We then induced anesthesia with methohexital and succinylcholine. After administration of electrical stimulation for ECT, the rate of infusion decreased to 300 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 for three additional minutes and was then discontinued. Statistically significant reductions in mean heart rate from minute 2 until minute 15 and in maximum heart rate (the mean of each patient's maximum heart rate after seizure changed from 152 +/- 23 to 115 +/- 24 beats/min) occurred in patients given esmolol. During and immediately after infusion, arterial blood pressure also decreased. Finally, the length of seizures decreased, as manifested clinically from 48 +/- 18 to 39 +/- 14 s and on electroencephalogram from 86 +/- 41 to 67 +/- 28 s. We conclude that esmolol effectively controls the hyperdynamic response to ECT and reduces the length of seizures. The significance of the latter to the overall effectiveness of ECT is not known.",

        "input": "H1-receptor antagonists have been utilized, following their initial chemical synthesis in 1933, both in the treatment of conditions in which histamine is considered to be of pathogenic importance and conversely to help elucidate the role of histamine in disease, through an evaluation of their influence on disease expression. While there is considerable indirect evidence to implicate histamine in the pathogenesis of asthma, a critical evaluation of H1-receptor antagonism in this condition has, until recently, proved difficult, as many of the early H1-receptor antagonists possessed additional actions, such as anti-cholinergic, local anaesthetic, alpha-adrenoceptor antagonistic and anti-serotonin activity. In addition, H1-receptor antagonists have been shown to have effects on mast cell function. In low concentrations in vitro, antihistamines have been found to inhibit immunologically stimulated mast cell mediator release, with the IC50 in the nanomolar to micromolar range, while at higher concentrations they induce histamine release. The potency of these drugs in producing such effects is unrelated to their H1-receptor blocking activity. Furthermore the sedative effects of these therapeutic agents limit the tolerable administrable dose and thus the degree of H1-receptor blockade achievable within the airways. The recent development of H1-receptor antagonists devoid of clinical sedative effects has enabled the administration of doses of H1-antihistamines which achieve a greater degree of H1-receptor blockade within the airways, thus permitting a better appraisal of the role of histamine in this condition. Furthermore, the receptor specificity of many of these agents has been focused such that terfenadine, astemizole, loratadine and cetirizine are devoid of anticholinergic activity and exhibit little alpha-antagonistic or anti-serotonin activity of clinical relevance. However, of these agents both loratadine and cetirizine possess additional actions likely to be of relevance to asthma. Pretreatment with loratadine has been shown to reduce the recovery of both histamine and prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) in nasal lavage fluid following nasal allergen challenge, a finding interpreted as indicative of in vivo mast cell stabilization, and cetirizine has been shown in vivo at therapeutic doses to inhibit allergen-induced eosinophil chemotaxis. Thus while both these agents offer the potential of an oral therapy for asthma based on an H1-receptor antagonist, their additional actions do not make them ideally suited to the exploration of the role of histamine in asthma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

Here, we report on the physical association of Panx1 with Kvbeta3 by immunoprecipitation when co-expressed in a neuroblastoma cell line (Neuro2A). Furthermore, in vivo co-expression of Panx1 and Kvbeta3 was shown to occur in murine hippocampus and cerebellum. Kvbeta3 is known to accelerate inactivation of otherwise slowly inactivating potassium channels under reducing conditions. We subsequently found that Panx1 channel currents exhibit a significant reduction when exposed to reducing agents, and that this effect is attenuated in the presence of Kvbeta3. Apparently, Kvbeta3 is involved in regulating the susceptibility of Panx1 channels to redox potential. Furthermore, the Panx1 channel blockers carbenoxolone and Probenecid were less effective in inhibiting Panx1 currents when Kvbeta3 was co-expressed. The influence of Kvbeta3 on Panx1 is the first example of modulation of Panx1 channel function(s) by interacting proteins, and suggests the physiological importance of sensing changes in redox potentials.",

        "input": "Despite more than a decade of research in the field of endocrine active compounds targeting the androgen receptor (AR), and although suitable cell lines can be obtained, no validated human stably transfected androgen sensitive transactivation assay is available. Bayer Schering Pharma (BSP) and the Flemish Institute for Technological Research (VITO), partners within the EU-sponsored 6th framework project ReProTect, made first steps towards such a validation. A standard operation protocol (SOP) developed at BSP based on the androgen sensitive PALM cell line was transferred to VITO and its performance and transferability were thoroughly studied. The investigation followed a generic protocol prepared for all reporter gene assays evaluated within ReProTect, and in both laboratories at least three independent experiments were performed. The highest concentration to be tested was limited to 10 microM, if needed. A few compounds, 17alpha-methyltestosterone (17alpha-MT), vinclozolin and linuron, were studied using a real world scenario, i.e., assuming that their interaction with the AR was not known: A prescreening for agonism and true, competitive antagonism was used to select conditions such as the appropriate mode of action, and the working range excluding cytotoxicity for the final screening. All other compounds were tested according to the generic protocol: Compounds screened for agonism were the reference androgen 17alpha-methyldihydrotestosterone (MDHT), levonorgestrel, norethynodrel, progesterone, o,p'-DDT, and dibutylphthalate (DBP), while compounds screened for antagonism were the reference anti-androgen flutamide, prochloraz, o,p'-DDT, progesterone, norethynodrel, and DBP. Cytotoxicity was assessed in parallel as lactate dehydrogenase release. The prescreen classified 17alpha-MT as androgenic, vinclozolin and linuron as anti-androgenic and compounds were tested accordingly. In the absence of cytotoxicity, appropriate androgenic properties of reference and test compounds were detected by both laboratories, o,p'-DDT and DBP had no androgenic activity. Across the two laboratories EC(50)-values for MDHT, 17alpha-MT, and levonorgestrel varied by not more than a factor of 3.4, for norethynodrel by a factor of 9.7. Progesterone effects could not fully be evaluated, as frequently concentration response curves were incomplete. In the absence of cytotoxicity anti-androgenic properties of reference and test compounds were also detected in both laboratories. DBP, the putative negative reference compound, was inactive, norethynodrel rather showed agonistic properties. Progesterone was an antagonist at low concentrations, but agonistic properties were observed in one laboratory at high concentrations. Since the highest test concentration was limited to 10 microM, for some compounds no complete concentration response curves were obtained and estimation of EC(50)-values was less robust. Our data demonstrated that the SOP was transferable, and that the assay was able to rank compounds with strong, weak, and without affinity for the AR and to discriminate agonists and antagonists. The sensitivity of the assay could be improved further, if the limit of solubility or beginning cytotoxicity was chosen as the highest test concentration. The assay avoids the use of tissues from laboratory animals, and thus contributes to the 3R concept. Furthermore, it could be adjusted to an intermediate/high throughput format. On the whole, this PALM assay is a promising candidate for further validation.",

        "input": "Heparin possesses antimetastatic effects that were related to various molecular mechanisms beyond anticoagulant activities. The ability of heparin to interfere with the function of adhesion receptors in the metastatic course appears as a promising therapeutic approach. This refers to numerous findings that heparin attenuates metastasis in a selectin-dependent manner. We recently demonstrated that heparin interferes with the integrin VLA-4 on murine melanoma cells binding to VCAM-1. To confirm this activity and to obtain further insight into molecular recognition of heparin by VLA-4, we investigated the inhibition of VLA-4 mediated binding of human melanoma MV3 cells to immobilised VCAM-1 by different heparins. The size of heparin has an important impact on inhibition. Unfractionated heparin (UFH) and tinzaparin, a low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) representing a mean of about 18-20 monomers, displayed high inhibitory activity. Fractionating tinzaparin to 14-18 monomers reduced inhibition slightly, while the pentasaccharide fondaparinux was without effects. To confirm molecular recognition of tinzaparin by VLA-4, a surface acoustic wave-biosensor was applied. A VLA-4 containing membrane preparation of MV3 cells was immobilised at the sensors to allow for detection of kinetic binding constants of tinzaparin compared to VCAM-1. Tinzaparin binds to VLA-4 with affinity in the low micromolar range (4.61 x 10(-6) M), which clearly indicates specific molecular recognition. Furthermore, tinzaparin displays a nearly identical k(off) compared to VCAM-1 (5.13 x 10(-3) s(-1) versus 3.44 x 10(-3) s(-1)) which is evident for interference with the ligand binding. The data provide evidence for a direct confirmation of heparin binding to VLA-4 and thus, contribute to understand the antimetastatic activity of heparin.",

The following assessments of bambuterol and terbutaline were performed: (1) effect on tracheal smooth muscle resting tension; (2) effect on contraction caused by 10(-6) M methacholine as a parasympathetic mimetic; (3) effect of the drugs on electrically induced tracheal smooth muscle contractions.

The maximum stimulation of Cdx2 and MUC2 mRNA induced by CDCA was observed at 3 h and by 6 h, respectively. GW4064 also induced expression of these molecules. The effects of CDCA and GW4064 on expression of Cdx2 and MUC2 were abolished by guggulsterone.

Phenols like the ones investigated here possess a CA inhibition mechanism distinct of that of the sulfonamides/sulfamates used clinically or the coumarins. Unlike the sulfonamides, which bind to the catalytic zinc ion, phenols are anchored at the Zn(II)-coordinated water molecule and bind more externally within the active site cavity, making contacts with various amino acid residues.

METH is well known to produce effects on the monoamine systems but it is unclear how METH affects SERT and memory. Here the effects of METH and the serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine (FLX) on autoshaping and novel object recognition (NOR) were investigated. Notably, both memory tasks recruit different behavioral, neural and cognitive demand. In autoshaping task a dose-response curve for METH was determined. METH (1.0mg/kg) impaired short-term memory (STM; lasting less of 90min) in NOR and impaired both STM and long-term memory (LTM; lasting 24 and 48h) in autoshaping, indicating that METH had long-lasting effects in the latter task. A comparative autoradiography study of the relationship between the binding pattern of SERT in autoshaping new untrained vs. trained treated (METH, FLX, or both) animals was made. Considering that hemispheric dominance is important for LTM, hence right vs. left hemisphere of the brain was compared. Results showed that trained animals decreased cortical SERT binding relative to untrained ones. In untrained and trained treated animals with the amnesic dose (1.0mg/kg) of METH SERT binding in several areas including hippocampus and cortex decreased, more remarkably in the trained animals. In contrast, FLX improved memory, increased SERT binding, prevented the METH amnesic effect and re-established the SERT binding.

Here, translocation studies using the human androgen receptor (hAR) and the human glucocorticoid receptor (hGR) were performed to aid in identifying the mechanism by which anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS) were activating hAR and potentially interacting with hGR and how glucocorticoid ligands were interacting with the hGR and hAR. The real-time analysis of EGFP-labeled hAR and hGR ligand-induced cytoplasm-to-nucleus translocation was performed using fluorescence microscopy to better understand the action of these NHRs in a physiologically relevant cell-based model. After transient transfection, the hAR and hGR individually translocate as expected (i.e., transport is ligand-induced and dose-dependent) in this model biological system. Testosterone (TEST) had the fastest translocation rate for the hAR of 0.0525 min(-1). The other endogenous steroids, androstenedione (ANE) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), had considerably lower hAR transport rates. The rates of hAR transport for the exogenous steroids methyltrienelone (MET), nandrolone (NAN), and oxandrolone (OXA) are lower than that of testosterone and similar to those of the endogenous steroids ANE and DHT. The hGR transport rates for cortisol (COR) and dexamethasone (DEX) are also presented. The synthetic GC, DEX, had a more rapid translocation rate (0.1599 min(-1)) at the highest dose of 100 nM compared to the endogenous GC COR (0.0431 min(-1)). The data obtained agrees with the existing qualitative data and adds an important ligand-dependent kinetic component to hAR and hGR transport. These kinetic data can aid our understanding of NHR action and interaction with other regulatory proteins, and can be useful in the development of new therapies.",

AHR could be produced by hypersensitivity of the airway smooth muscle or hyperreactivity of the airways. This study was conducted to ascertain whether AHR in a murine model of asthma is produced by changes at the level of the airway smooth muscle. Airway smooth muscle responses were characterised in vitro in isolated trachea spirals from naive mice and from an acute ovalbumin (OVA) challenge model of allergic asthma. AHR was investigated in vivo in conscious, freely moving mice. Inflammatory cell influx into the lungs and antibody responses to the antigen were also measured. In vitro study of tracheal airway smooth muscle from naive mice demonstrated concentration-related contractions to methacholine and 5-HT, but no responses to histamine or adenosine or its stable analogue, 5'-N-ethyl-carboxamidoadenosine. The contractions to 5-HT were inhibited by ketanserin and alosetron indicating involvement of 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(3) receptors, respectively. In an acute model of allergic asthma, OVA-treated mice were shown to be atopic by inflammatory cell influx to the lungs after OVA challenge, increases in total IgE and OVA-specific IgG levels and contractions to OVA in isolated trachea. In the asthmatic model, AHR to methacholine was demonstrated in conscious, freely moving mice in vivo and in isolated trachea in vitro 24 and 72h after OVA challenge. No AHR in vitro was seen for 5-HT, histamine or adenosine. These results suggest that, in our mouse model of asthma, changes occur at the level of the muscarinic receptor transduction pathway of coupling to airway smooth muscle contraction. These changes are maintained when tissues are removed from the inflammatory environment and for at least 3 days.",

Numerous studies have suggested that increased TS levels are associated closely with resistance to fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy. TAS-102 is a novel drug containing trifluorothymidine, which is phosphorylated by TK-1 to its active monophosphated form, that in turn can inhibit TS. TAS-102 has been shown to exhibit antitumor activity in fluoropyrimidine-resistant human cancer cells. TAS-102 is currently undergoing clinical trials for use in gastrointestinal cancers. In the present study, we used immunohistochemistry to investigate the expression of TK-1 and TS in various types of cancer. TK-1 and TS expression was markedly different between cancer types. High TK-1 expression was detected prominently in gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas and esophageal and uterine squamous cell carcinomas. Gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas and squamous cell uterine carcinomas were often accompanied by high TS expression, indicating activation of pyrimidine synthesis through both the salvage and de novo pathways. These results led us to consider that TAS-102 may also be effective for esophageal and uterine squamous cell carcinomas, as well as for gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas, even in fluoropyrimidine-resistant cases with high TS expression. In contrast, thyroid papillary carcinomas, lung adenocarcinomas, hepatocellular carcinomas, pancreatic ductal carcinomas, and renal cell carcinomas, which exhibit low TK-1 expression, may be resistant to TAS-102. In non-small cell lung cancers, high TK-1 expression was demonstrated in squamous cell carcinomas, but not in adenocarcinomas. This result suggests that TAS-102 efficacy and the pyrimidine synthetic pathway may differ depending on histological type.

Numerous studies indicate that S100A4 is not simply a marker for metastatic disease, but rather has a direct role in metastatic progression. These observations suggest that S100A4 is an excellent target for therapeutic intervention. Using a unique biosensor-based assay, trifluoperazine (TFP) was identified as an inhibitor that disrupts the S100A4/myosin-IIA interaction. To examine the interaction of S100A4 with TFP, we determined the 2.3 A crystal structure of human Ca(2+)-S100A4 bound to TFP. Two TFP molecules bind within the hydrophobic target binding pocket of Ca(2+)-S100A4 with no significant conformational changes observed in the protein upon complex formation. NMR chemical shift perturbations are consistent with the crystal structure and demonstrate that TFP binds to the target binding cleft of S100A4 in solution. Remarkably, TFP binding results in the assembly of five Ca(2+)-S100A4/TFP dimers into a tightly packed pentameric ring. Within each pentamer most of the contacts between S100A4 dimers occurs through the TFP moieties. The Ca(2+)-S100A4/prochlorperazine (PCP) complex exhibits a similar pentameric assembly. Equilibrium sedimentation and cross-linking studies demonstrate the cooperative formation of a similarly sized S100A4/TFP oligomer in solution. Assays examining the ability of TFP to block S100A4-mediated disassembly of myosin-IIA filaments demonstrate that significant inhibition of S100A4 function occurs only at TFP concentrations that promote S100A4 oligomerization. Together these studies support a unique mode of inhibition in which phenothiazines disrupt the S100A4/myosin-IIA interaction by sequestering S100A4 via small molecule-induced oligomerization.",

Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), ACTH, and cortisol were measured every 10 min from healthy males during the awakening period or late afternoon using an automated blood sampling system. Mathematical modeling into discrete pulses of activity revealed that intravenous infusion of the synthetic mixed glucocorticoid/mineralocorticoid agonist prednisolone produced rapid inhibition of ACTH and cortisol pulsatility within 30 min in the morning and afternoon. Any pulse that had commenced at the time of injection was unaffected, and subsequent pulsatility was inhibited. Prednisolone also inhibited ACTH and cortisol secretion in response to exogenous CRH stimulation, inferring rapid feedback inhibition at the anterior pituitary. Circulating POMC peptide concentrations were unaffected, suggesting that the rapid corticosteroid inhibitory effect specifically targeted ACTH secretion from pituitary corticotrophs.

Histamine H4 receptor (H4R) perturbation has previously been shown to modify acute inflammation and Th2 cytokine production in a murine model of asthma. We examined the ability of H4R antagonists to therapeutically modify the effects of Th2 cytokine production such as goblet cell hyperplasia (GCH), and collagen deposition in a sub-chronic model of asthma. In addition, effects on Th2 mediated lung dysfunction were also determined. METHODS: Mice were sensitized to ovalbumin (OVA) followed by repeated airway challenge with OVA. After inflammation was established mice were dosed with the H4R antagonist, JNJ 7777120, or anti-IL-13 antibody for comparison. Airway hyperreactivity (AHR) was measured, lungs lavaged and tissues collected for analysis. RESULTS: Therapeutic H4R antagonism inhibited T cell infiltration in to the lung and decreased Th2 cytokines IL-13 and IL-5. IL-13 dependent remodeling parameters such as GCH and lung collagen were reduced. Intervention with H4R antagonist also improved measures of central and peripheral airway dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that therapeutic H4R antagonism can significantly ameliorate allergen induced, Th2 cytokine driven pathologies such as lung remodeling and airway dysfunction. The ability of H4R antagonists to affect these key manifestations of asthma suggests their potential as novel human therapeutics.",

Studies have shown that a combination of VP-16 with other drugs demonstrates better clinical responses. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of moxifloxacin (MXF) and VP-16 on cellular topo II activity in drug-treated cells and evaluate the influence of MXF on the mode of action of VP-16, on proliferation and apoptosis of HT-29 cells. Decatenation assay, band depletion and Western blot analysis, cytotoxic assay (MTT), flow cytometric studies (cell cycle and survivin expression), apoptosis (DAPI-sulforhodamine staining and caspase 3 activity) and IL-8 and VEGF secretion were determined. MXF or VP-16 slightly affected cellular topo II activity in nuclear extracts derived from drug-treated cells while the combination enhanced inhibitory activity and the reduction in band depletion of topo II. VP-16 induced cell cycle arrest at G2/M and the appearance of the subG1 peak which was increased by the addition of MXF. Apoptosis studies (DAPI staining and caspase 3 activity) showed a marked increase in the presence of MXF and VP-16 compared to VP-16 alone. VP-16 induced the release of IL-8, and addition of MXF reduced enhanced release and the spontaneous release of VEGF from the cells. In conclusion, the results suggest that the enhancement in the reduction of topo II activity by the combined MXF/VP-16 treatments was probably due to the increase in the level of the DNA-enzyme cleavable complexes formed by both drugs. The unique combination of MXF/VP-16 may have clinical benefits and a cytotoxic drug 'sparing effect' and should be further studied in vivo.",

It has demonstrated neuroprotective properties in laboratory studies. Current concepts of PD aetiopathogenesis include the role of alpha-synuclein, protein aggregation, free radical metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction in contributing to cell death. We have used a combination of alpha-synuclein and free radical mediated toxicity in a dopaminergic cell line to provide a model of nigral toxicity in order to investigate the potential molecular mechanisms that mediate rasagiline protection. We demonstrate that rasagiline protects against cell death induced by the combination of free radicals generated by paraquat and either wild-type or A53T mutant alpha-synuclein over-expression. This protection was associated with a reduction in caspase 3 activation, a reduction in superoxide generation and a trend to ameliorate the fall in mitochondrial membrane potential. Rasagiline induced an increase in cellular glutathione levels. The results support a role for rasagiline in protecting dopaminergic cells against free radical mediated damage and apoptosis in the presence of alpha-synuclein over-expression. The data are of relevance to the interpretation of the potential mechanisms of action of rasagiline in explaining the results of disease modification trials in PD.",

        "input": "The Ca(2+) dependent interaction between troponin I (cTnI) and troponin C (cTnC) triggers contraction in heart muscle. Heart failure is characterized by a decrease in cardiac output, and compounds that increase the sensitivity of cardiac muscle to Ca(2+) have therapeutic potential. The Ca(2+)-sensitizer, levosimendan, targets cTnC; however, detailed understanding of its mechanism has been obscured by its instability. In order to understand how this class of positive inotropes function, we investigated the mode of action of two fluorine containing novel analogs of levosimendan; 2',4'-difluoro(1,1'-biphenyl)-4-yloxy acetic acid (dfbp-o) and 2',4'-difluoro(1,1'-biphenyl)-4-yl acetic acid (dfbp). The affinities of dfbp and dfbp-o for the regulatory domain of cTnC were measured in the absence and presence of cTnI by NMR spectroscopy, and dfbp-o was found to bind more strongly than dfbp. Dfbp-o also increased the affinity of cTnI for cTnC. Dfbp-o increased the Ca(2+)-sensitivity of demembranated cardiac trabeculae in a manner similar to levosimendan. The high resolution NMR solution structure of the cTnC-cTnI-dfbp-o ternary complex showed that dfbp-o bound at the hydrophobic interface formed by cTnC and cTnI making critical interactions with residues such as Arg147 of cTnI. In the absence of cTnI, docking localized dfbp-o to the same position in the hydrophobic groove of cTnC. The structural and functional data reveal that the levosimendan class of Ca(2+)-sensitizers work by binding to the regulatory domain of cTnC and stabilizing the pivotal cTnC-cTnI regulatory unit via a network of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, in contrast to the destabilizing effects of antagonists such as W7 at the same interface.",

Such interaction, if present at the level of respiratory tract, may be of interest to pathogenesis of ASA-induced asthma. We performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized cross-over study on the effect of choline magnesium trisalicylate (CMT, trilisate) pre-treatment on ASA-induced adverse reactions in nine patients. Pulmonary function tests, nasal symptoms score, PNIF and serum salicylate levels were monitored following challenges with threshold doses of ASA. Trilisate administered at a dose of 3000 mg daily for 3 days, offered a moderate protection against ASA-induced symptoms; it diminished the severity and/or delayed the appearance of FEV1 fall. Maximal decreases in FEV1 as well as reaction intensity indexes were significantly lower (P less than 0.02 and P less than 0.002, respectively) after trilisate pre-treatment as compared to placebo. Trilisate also attenuated nasal symptoms in three out of five patients.

BDZs and other positive GABA(A)R modulators, including barbiturates, ethanol, and neurosteroids, can also inhibit L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (L-VGCCs), which could contribute to reduced neuronal excitability. Because neuronal L-VGCC function is up-regulated after long-term GABA(A)R modulator exposure, an interaction with L-VGCCs may also play a role in physical dependence. The current studies assessed the effects of BDZs (diazepam, flurazepam, and desalkylflurazepam), allopregnanolone, pentobarbital, and ethanol on whole-cell Ba(2+) currents through recombinant neuronal Ca(v)1.2 and Ca(v)1.3 L-VGCCs expressed with beta(3) and alpha(2)delta-1 in HEK293T cells. Allopregnanolone was the most potent inhibitor (IC(50), approximately 10 muM), followed by BDZs (IC(50), approximately 50 muM), pentobarbital (IC(50), 0.3-1 mM), and ethanol (IC(50), approximately 300 mM). Ca(v)1.3 channels were less sensitive to pentobarbital inhibition than Ca(v)1.2 channels, similar to dihydropyridine (DHP) L-VGCC antagonists. All GABA(A)R modulators induced a negative shift in the steady-state inactivation curve of Ca(v)1.3 channels, but only BDZs and pentobarbital induced a negative shift in Ca(v)1.2 channel inactivation. Mutation of the high-affinity DHP binding site (T1039Y and Q1043M) in Ca(v)1.2 channels reduced pentobarbital potency. Despite the structural similarity between benzothiazepines and BDZs, mutation of an amino acid important for diltiazem potency (I1150A) did not affect diazepam potency. Although L-VGCC inhibition by BDZs occurred at concentrations that are possibly too high to be clinically relevant and is not likely to play a role in the up-regulation of L-VGCCs during long-term treatment, pentobarbital and ethanol inhibited L-VGCCs at clinically relevant concentrations.",

        "input": "Aspirin is a salicylate drug that is extensively used for its anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, analgesic and anti-thrombotic effects. More recently, it has been shown to decrease the incidence of cancers of epithelial origin. In most cases, aspirin is relatively safe. However, it does cause a host of adverse effects and toxicities, including gastrointestinal bleeding, ulcerations, nephrotoxicity and hypersensitivity reactions. Although the inhibition of cyclooxygenases by aspirin, which leads to its anti-inflammatory/analgesic properties, has been well studied, the mechanisms involved in its chemopreventive effects as well as some of its adverse effects are as yet ill-defined. Studies over the past decades suggest that, besides cyclooxygenases, aspirin acetylates other cellular proteins. These studies used radiolabeled 3H or 14C aspirin, the only approach used to date for the detection of proteins acetylated by aspirin. In a recent study using protein-specific anti-acetyl lysine antibodies and immunological methods, we demonstrated the ability of aspirin to acetylate the tumor suppressor protein p53. In this review, we present current research from the literature on the aspirin-induced acetylation of proteins. We also describe an immunological approach to detecting acetylated proteins in aspirin-treated cells, and demonstrate that multiple proteins are acetylated. Since post-translational modification of proteins, such as acetylation, may lead to the alteration of their function, it is possible that some of the hitherto unexplained beneficial or adverse effects of aspirin could occur as a result of these modifications. The identification of these novel acetylation targets of aspirin represents a new area for investigation.",

We found that PSE inhibits interleukin-2 (IL-2) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha-gene transcription in stimulated Jurkat cells, a human T-cell leukemia cell line. To further characterize the inhibitory mechanisms of PSE at the transcriptional level, we examined the transcriptional activities of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB), nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), and activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factors and found that PSE inhibited NF-kappaB-dependent transcriptional activity without affecting either the phosphorylation, the degradation of the cytoplasmic NF-kappaB inhibitory protein, IkappaBalpha or the DNA-binding activity. However, phosphorylation of the p65/RelA subunit was clearly inhibited by PSE in stimulated cells. In addition, PSE inhibited the transcriptional activity of NFAT without interfering with the calcium-induced NFAT dephosphorylation event, which represents the major signaling pathway for its activation. NFAT cooperates with c-Jun, a compound of the AP-1 complex, to activate target genes, and we also found that PSE inhibited both JNK activation and AP-1 transcriptional activity.

METHODS: VMAT-1 mRNA was detected in mouse brain with RT-PCR. The cDNA was sequenced, cloned into an expression vector, transfected into COS-1 cells, and cell protein was assayed for VMAT-1 activity. Immunoreactive proteins were examined on western blots probed with four different antibodies to VMAT-1. RESULTS: Sequencing confirmed identity of the entire coding sequences of VMAT-1 cDNA from mouse medulla oblongata/pons and adrenal to a Gen-Bank reference sequence. Transfection of the brain cDNA into COS-1 cells resulted in transporter activity that was blocked by the VMAT inhibitor reserpine and a proton ionophore, but not by tetrabenazine, which has a high affinity for VMAT-2. Antibodies to either the C- or N- terminus of VMAT-1 detected two proteins (73 and 55 kD) in transfected COS-1 cells. The C-terminal antibodies detected both proteins in extracts of mouse medulla/pons, cortex, hypothalamus, and cerebellum but only the 73 kD protein and higher molecular weight immunoreactive proteins in mouse adrenal and rat PC12 cells, which are positive controls for rodent VMAT-1.

In this paper we have summarized the mechanisms responsible for first-pass intestinal pharmacokinetic interactions by investigating the intestinal permeability of some cardiovascular, antiviral drugs, their transport with hepatic transporters and CYP3A4 metabolism. Transporter-enzyme interplay was studied with several in vitro models of varying complexity: rat small intestine and Caco-2 cell monolayers were used in studies of intestinal processes, and hepatic pharmacokinetics was monitored in HepG2 cells, isolated rat hepatocytes and rat liver slices. Garlic phytochemicals from aged garlic extract modified the activities of secretory and absorptive transporters in both intestine and liver and competitively inhibited CYP3A4 enzyme. The increased activities of the most important intestinal efflux (P-glycoprotein - Pgp, Multidrug Resistance Associated Protein 2 - MRP-2, Breast Cancer Resistance Protein - BCRP) and uptake (MonoCarboxylate Transporter 1 - MCT1, Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide - OATP, Peptide transporter 1 - PepT1) transporters were caused by changes in electrophysiological membrane properties and by allosteric modifications.

The amines bind to the enzyme by a direct coordination to the high-spin (S = 5/2) Fe(III) at the active site (charge transfer interaction), as seen by resonance Raman and EPR spectroscopy. Experimental evidence is presented that a group with an apparent pKa value of about 5.1 (20 degrees C) is involved in the interaction between the catecholamine and the enzyme. The high-affinity binding of L-noradrenaline to phenylalanine hydroxylase, as studied by equilibrium microdialysis (anaerobically) and ultrafiltration (aerobically), shows positive cooperativity (h = 1.9); at pH 7.2 and 20 degrees C the rat enzyme binds about 0.5 mol L-noradrenaline/mol subunit with a half-maximal binding (S50) at 0.25 microM L-noradrenaline. No binding to the ferrous form of the enzyme was observed. The affinity decreases with decreasing pH, by phosphorylation and by preincubation of the enzyme with the substrate L-phenylalanine, while it increases after alkylation of the enzyme with the activator N-ethylmaleimide. Preincubation of the enzyme with L-phenylalanine also leads to a complete loss of the cooperativity of L-noradrenaline binding (h = 1.0). The many similarities in binding properties of the inhibitor L-noradrenaline and the activator/substrate L-phenylalanine makes it likely that the cooperative interactions of these effectors are due to their binding to the same site. The high-affinity of catecholamines to phenylalanine hydroxylase is a valuable probe to study the active site of this enzyme and is also relevant for the homologous enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase, which is purified as a stable catecholamine-Fe(III) complex.",

The non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)-associated EGFR mutants, L858R and G719S, are constitutively active and oncogenic. They display sensitivity to TK inhibitors, including gefitinib and erlotinib. In contrast, the secondary mutation of the gatekeeper residue, T790M, reportedly confers inhibitor resistance on the oncogenic EGFR mutants. In this study, our biochemical analyses revealed that the introduction of the T790M mutation confers gefitinib resistance on the G719S mutant. The G719S/T790M double mutant has enhanced activity and retains high gefitinib-binding affinity. The T790M mutation increases the ATP affinity of the G719S mutant, explaining the acquired drug resistance of the double mutant. Structural analyses of the G719S/T790M double mutant, as well as the wild type and the G719S and L858R mutants, revealed that the T790M mutation stabilizes the hydrophobic spine of the active EGFR-TK conformation. The Met790 side chain of the G719S/T790M double mutant, in the apo form and gefitinib- and AMPPNP-bound forms, adopts different conformations that explain the accommodation of these ligands. In the L858R mutant structure, the active-site cleft is expanded by the repositioning of Phe723 within the P-loop. Notably, the introduction of the F723A mutation greatly enhanced the gefitinib sensitivity of the wild-type EGFR in vivo, supporting our hypothesis that the expansion of the active-site cleft results in enhanced gefitinib sensitivity.

Wingless-type MMTV integration site family members (WNTs) are secreted glycoproteins involved in embryogenesis and, on inappropriate expression in the adult, in cancer. Here, we show expression of WNT6 in GC patient specimens, human GC cell lines and in a mouse model of GC. In human GC cells, WNT6 expression was enhanced by caveolin-1 (Cav1), a scaffold protein of plasma membrane caveolae. WNT6 knock-down and overexpression experiments demonstrated that WNT6 increased the resistance to apoptotic cell death induced by the anthracycline chemotherapeutics epirubicin (Epi) and doxorubicin (Dox). Epi increased the activity of the human WNT6 promoter through Cav1-dependent binding of \u03b2-catenin to the proximal WNT6 promoter. Epi increased both WNT6/Wnt6 and Cav1 expression in human GC cells and within the tumor area of a murine model of GC (CEA424-SV40 TAg). In GC patients, WNT6 expression was positively associated with the tumor stage and the nodal status, and inversely correlated with the response to ECF (Epi, cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil) chemotherapy. These results showed that WNT6 and Cav1 are upregulated by chemotherapeutics and enhance the resistance of GC cells to anthracycline drugs. Understanding the molecular mechanisms driving WNT6/Cav1-induced drug resistance will provide benefits in developing new therapies for GC.",

LY541850 was claimed from human mGlu receptors expressed in non-neuronal cells to be a selective orthosteric mGlu2 agonist and mGlu3 antagonist. We have verified this pharmacological profile of LY541850 in hippocampal slices. Field excitatory post-synaptic potentials (fEPSPs) evoked by stimulation of the temporo-ammonic path (TAP) input to CA1 stratum lacunosum moleculare (SLM) were inhibited by LY541850 in mGlu3-/- mice (EC(50) 38 nM) and wild-type littermates (EC(50) 42 nM) to a similar extent but were not significantly affected in mGlu2-/- mice. The group II agonist, DCG-IV, inhibited the fEPSP in all three genotypes. Co-application of DCG-IV and LY541850 in mGlu3-/- and wild-type littermates resulted in an additive effect, whereas in mGlu2-/- mice, LY541850 reversed the inhibitory action of DCG-IV. These results confirm the selective mGlu2 agonist and mGlu3 antagonist actions of LY541850. A similar profile of activity was seen in medial perforant path synapse to the dentate gyrus. Systemic administration of LY541850 to wild-type mice, reduced the increase in locomotor activity following both phencyclidine and amphetamine administration. These data support the hypothesis that mGlu2 receptors mediate the antipsychotic effects of mixed group II agonists.

The R-enantiomer of modafinil might have unique pharmacological properties that should be further investigated. METHODS: (+/-)-Modafinil and its R-(-)- and S-(+)-enantiomers were synthesized and tested for inhibition of [(3)H] dopamine (DA) uptake and [(3)H]WIN 35428 binding in human dopamine transporter (DAT) wild-type and mutants with altered conformational equilibria. Data were compared with cocaine and the atypical DA uptake inhibitor, JHW 007. R- and S-modafinil were also evaluated in microdialysis studies in the mouse nucleus accumbens shell and in a cocaine discrimination procedure. RESULTS: (+/-)-, R-, and S-modafinil bind to the DAT and inhibit DA uptake less potently than cocaine, with R-modafinil having approximately threefold higher affinity than its S-enantiomer. Molecular docking studies revealed subtle differences in binding modes for the enantiomers. R-modafinil was significantly less potent in the DAT Y156F mutant compared with wild-type DAT, whereas S-modafinil was affected less. Studies with the Y335A DAT mutant showed that the R- and S-enantiomers tolerated the inward-facing conformation better than cocaine, which was further supported by [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]-methanethiosulfonate reactivity on the DAT E2C I159C. Microdialysis studies demonstrated that both R- and S-modafinil produced increases in extracellular DA concentrations in the nucleus accumbens shell less efficaciously than cocaine and with a longer duration of action. Both enantiomers fully substituted in mice trained to discriminate cocaine from saline. CONCLUSIONS: R-modafinil displays an in vitro profile different from cocaine. Future trials with R-modafinil as a substitute therapy with the potential benefit of cognitive enhancement for psychostimulant addiction are warranted.",

Here, we assessed the activity of Silibinin on apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest in human gastric cells culture system using SGC-7901 as the model. Silibinin treatment could inhibit the cell growth and cause a prominent G2 phase arrest and apoptosis in dose- and time-dependent manner. In mechanistic studies, Silibinin decreased the protein level of p34cdc2, which might be the possible molecular mechanism of Silibinin efficacy on the growth inhibition in SGC-7901 cells. In addition, Silibinin caused an increase in p53 and p21 protein level as well as mRNA levels. Interestingly, Silibinin-induced apoptosis in SGC-7901 cells was independent of caspases activation. These results indicated that Silibinin is a cell-cycle regulator and apoptosis inducer in human gastric carcinoma SGC-7901 cells and might be used as a candidate chemopreventive agent for gastric carcinoma prevention and intervention.

Herein, we report the pharmacological actions of Lu AF21934, a novel, selective, and brain-penetrant positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of the mGlu(4) receptor in the stress-induced hyperthermia (SIH), four-plate, marble-burying and Vogel's conflict tests. In all models, except Vogel's conflict test, a dose-dependent anxiolytic-like effect was seen. The anti-hyperthermic effect of Lu AF21934 (5 mg/kg) in the SIH test was inhibited by the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil (10 mg/kg) and was not serotonin-dependent, as it persisted in serotonin-deficient mice and upon blockade of either 5-HT(1A) receptors by WAY100635, or 5-HT(2A/2C) receptors by ritanserin. These results suggest that the GABAergic system, but not the serotonergic system, is involved in the mechanism of the anxiolytic-like phenotype of Lu AF21934 in rodents.

        "input": "Group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1 and 5) are G protein coupled receptors that regulate neuronal activity in a number of ways. Some of the most well studied functions of group I mGluRs, such as initiation of multiple forms of mGluR-dependent long-term depression, require receptor localization near the post-synaptic density (PSD). This localization is in turn dependent on the Homer family of scaffolding proteins which bind to a small motif on the distal C-termini of mGluR1 and 5, localize the receptors near the PSD, strengthen coupling to post-synaptic effectors and simultaneously uncouple the mGluRs from extra-synaptic effectors such as voltage dependent ion channels. Here the selectivity of this uncoupling process was examined by testing the ability of Homer-2b to uncouple mGluR1 from multiple voltage dependent calcium channels including Ca(V2.2) (N-type), Ca(V3.2) (T-type), and Ca(V2.1) (P/Q-type) expressed in rat sympathetic neurons from the superior cervical ganglion (SCG). Of these, only the mGluR1-Ca(V2.1) modulatory pathway was insensitive to Homer-2b expression. Uncoupling from this channel was achieved by co-expression of an mGluR1 C-terminal protein designed to disrupt a previously described direct interaction between these two proteins, suggesting that this interaction allows incorporation of Ca(V2.1) into the mGluR1/Homer signaling complex, thereby preserving modulation in the presence of scaffolding Homer proteins.

A significant decrease of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities and glutathione (GSH) levels and an increase of malondialdehyde (MDA) quantity was observed after CCl4 and PC administration alone.

We previously showed that heterozygous mice with an R740S mutation in the a3 subunit of V-ATPase (+/R740S) have mild osteopetrosis resulting from an \u223c90% reduction in proton translocation across osteoclast membranes. Here we show that lysosomal pH is also higher in +/R740S compared with wild-type (+/+) osteoclasts. Both osteoclast number and size were decreased in cultures of +/R740S compared with +/+ bone marrow cells, with concomitant decreased expression of key osteoclast markers (TRAP, cathepsin K, OSCAR, DC-STAMP, and NFATc1), suggesting that low lysosomal pH plays an important role in osteoclastogenesis. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of this inhibition, NFATc1 activation was assessed. NFATc1 nuclear translocation was significantly reduced in +/R740S compared with +/+ cells; however, this was not because of impaired enzymatic activity of calcineurin, the phosphatase responsible for NFATc1 dephosphorylation. Protein and RNA expression levels of regulator of calcineurin 1 (RCAN1), an endogenous inhibitor of NFATc1 activation and a protein degraded in lysosomes, were not significantly different between +/R740S and +/+ osteoclasts, but the RCAN1/NFATc1 ratio was significantly higher in +/R740S versus +/+ cells. The lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine significantly increased RCAN1 accumulation in +/+ cells, consistent with the hypothesis that higher lysosomal pH impairs RCAN1 degradation, leading to a higher RCAN1/NFATc1 ratio and consequently NFATc1 inhibition. Our data indicate that increased lysosomal pH in osteoclasts leads to decreased NFATc1 signaling and nuclear translocation, resulting in a cell autonomous impairment of osteoclastogenesis in vitro.",

This export is mediated by the breast cancer resistance protein (ABCG2). The ultimate carcinogenic Phase I BP metabolite anti-BP-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide (BPDE) can be detoxified by glutathione conjugate formation catalyzed by glutathione S-transferases. In the present study, differentiated human intestinal Caco-2 cells were used as a model for the human small intestine to investigate the detoxification of BPDE and excretion of stereoisomeric glutathione conjugates in the presence of an inhibitor of the glutathione-cleaving enzyme \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase at the cell surface. The results indicate that the glutathione conjugates of BPDE are formed and excreted mainly to the apical and to a minor extent to the basolateral side of polarized Caco-2 monolayers. Inhibition studies revealed that the multidrug resistance-associated proteins (ABCCs) are involved in the transport of BPDE glutathione conjugates. Stable ABCC1, ABCC2 and ABCC3 knockdown cell lines were generated, thus making it possible to demonstrate that ABCC1 mediates the basolateral and ABCC2 the apical excretion of BPDE glutathione conjugates. In conclusion, the ultimate carcinogen BPDE is detoxified via glutathione conjugation and subsequently excreted by Caco-2 cells in both apical and basolateral directions.

        "input": "The insulin/IGF-1 pathway controls a number of physiological processes in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, including development, aging and stress response. We previously found that the Akt/PKB ortholog AKT-1 dampens the apoptotic response to genotoxic stress in the germline by negatively regulating the p53-like transcription factor CEP-1. Here, we report unexpected rearrangements to the insulin/IGF-1 pathway, whereby the insulin-like receptor DAF-2 and 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase PDK-1 oppose AKT-1 to promote DNA damage-induced apoptosis. While DNA damage does not affect phosphorylation at the PDK-1 site Thr350/Thr308 of AKT-1, it increased phosphorylation at Ser517/Ser473. Although ablation of daf-2 or pdk-1 completely suppressed akt-1-dependent apoptosis, the transcriptional activation of CEP-1 was unaffected, suggesting that daf-2 and pdk-1 act independently or downstream of cep-1 and akt-1. Ablation of the akt-1 paralog akt-2 or the downstream target of the insulin/IGF-1 pathway daf-16 (a FOXO transcription factor) restored sensitivity to damage-induced apoptosis in daf-2 and pdk-1 mutants. In addition, daf-2 and pdk-1 mutants have reduced levels of phospho-MPK-1/ERK in their germ cells, indicating that the insulin/IGF-1 pathway promotes Ras signaling in the germline. Ablation of the Ras effector gla-3, a negative regulator of mpk-1, restored sensitivity to apoptosis in daf-2 mutants, suggesting that gla-3 acts downstream of daf-2. In addition, the hypersensitivity of let-60/Ras gain-of-function mutants to damage-induced apoptosis was suppressed to wild-type levels by ablation of daf-2. Thus, insulin/IGF-1 signaling selectively engages AKT-2/DAF-16 to promote DNA damage-induced germ cell apoptosis downstream of CEP-1 through the Ras pathway.",

The objective of this study was to examine the effect of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation by 2-deoxyglucose on protein synthesis and the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway in bovine mammary epithelial cells. Phosphorylation of AMPK at Thr172 increased by 1.4-fold within 5 min, and remained elevated throughout a 30-min time course, in response to 2-deoxyglucose. Global rates of protein synthesis declined by 78% of control values. The decline in protein synthesis was associated with repression of mTORC1 signaling, as indicated by reduced phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 and eIF4E binding protein-1 (4E-BP1). Phosphorylation of ER-stress marker eIF2\u03b1 was also increased but only at 30 min of 2-deoxyglucose exposure. 2-Deoxyglucose increased phosphorylation of tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) on AMPK consensus sites but did not change the amount of TSC1 bound to TSC2. Activation of AMPK did not result in changes in the amount of raptor bound to mTOR. The inhibitory effects of AMPK activation on mTORC1 signaling were associated with a marked increase in Ser792 phosphorylation on raptor. Collectively, the results suggest that activation of AMPK represses global protein synthesis in mammary epithelial cells through inhibition of mTORC1 signaling.",

This system delivered a continuous airborne exposure of NPs to lung cells without loss of cell viability in repeated 4h exposure periods. We sequentially exposed cells to air-delivered copper (Cu) NPs in vitro to compare toxicity results to our prior in vivo inhalation studies. The evaluation of cellular dosimetry indicated that a large amount of Cu was taken up, dissolved and released into the basolateral medium (62% of total mass). Exposure to Cu NPs decreased cell viability to 73% (p<0.01) and significantly (p<0.05) elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase, intracellular reactive oxygen species and interleukin-8 that mirrored our findings from subacute in vivo inhalation studies in mice.

In the present study, we examined neuroinflammation, amyloidogenesis, and memory performance following intracerebral infusions of leukotriene D4 (LTD4) in mice. The results demonstrated that intracerebral infusions of LTD4 (1 ng/mouse) produced memory impairment as determined by Morris water maze test and Y-maze test in mice, and caused the accumulation of A\u03b21-40 and A\u03b21-42 in the hippocampus and cortex through increased activity of \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretases accompanied with increased expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP). LTD4 also induced expression of cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 (CysLT(1)R) and NF-\u03baB p65 in the hippocampus and cortex. Pretreatment with pranlukast (1.5 ng/mouse, intracerebroventricularly), a CysLT(1)R antagonist, blocked LTD4-induced amyloidogenesis, memory deficits. Pranlukast (0.6 \u03bcM) also prevented LTD4 (20 nM)-induced amyloidogenesis in the cultured neurons in vitro. Moreover, LTD4-induced increases in CysLT(1)R and NF-\u03baB p65 in the brain were also attenuated by pranlukast. These results suggest that LTD4 increases A\u03b2 peptide burden via activation of CysLT(1)R, which further affects APP levels and activity of \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretases via the NF-\u03baB pathway.

Pioglitazone, Bisphenol A diglycidyl ether, BADGE, IP injected (Peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor gamma (PPAR-\u03b3) antagonist), or their combination were administered to rats one hour before cisplatin injection.

The obtained results showed that pioglitazone improved the renal function, structural changes, renal malondialdehyde (MDA), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) genes expression in cisplatin injected rats. It increased both renal reduced glutathione (GSH) content and PPAR-\u03b3 gene expression. In contrast to the data obtained by prior administration of BADGE.

In this chapter we discuss the multiple activities of the SVMPs. In addition to hemorrhagic activity, members of the SVMP family also have fibrin(ogen)olytic activity, act as prothrombin activators, activate blood coagulation factor X, possess apoptotic activity, inhibit platelet aggregation, are pro-inflammatory and inactivate blood serine proteinase inhibitors. Clearly the SVMPs have multiple functions in addition to their well-known hemorrhagic activity. The realization that there are structural variations in the SVMPs and the early studies that led to their classification represents an important event in our understanding of the structural forms of the SVMPs. The SVMPs were subdivided into the P-I, P-II and P-III protein classes. The noticeable characteristic that distinguished the different classes was their size (molecular weight) differences and domain structure: Class I (P-I), the small SVMPs, have molecular masses of 20-30\u00a0kDa, contain only a pro domain and the proteinase domain; Class II (P-II), the medium size SVMPs, molecular masses of 30-60\u00a0kDa, contain the pro domain, proteinase domain and disintegrin domain; Class III (P-III), the large SVMPs, have molecular masses of 60-100\u00a0kDa, contain pro, proteinase, disintegrin-like and cysteine-rich domain structure. Another significant advance in the SVMP field was the characterization of the crystal structure of the first P-I class SVMP. The structures of other P-I SVMPs soon followed and the structures of P-III SVMPs have also been determined. The active site of the metalloproteinase domain has a consensus HEXXHXXGXXHD sequence and a Met-turn. The \"Met-turn\" structure contains a conserved Met residue that forms a hydrophobic basement for the three zinc-binding histidines in the consensus sequence.",

In addition, cells treated by wogonoside developed autophagosome-like characteristics, including single and double membrane vacuoles containing intact and degraded cellular debris. The results showed that wogonoside promotes the expression of LC3-II and Beclin-1. Furthermore, wogonoside inhibited cell growth of MDA-MB-231 cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, which was associated with wogonoside-induced autophagy. Wogonoside also suppressed the activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and p70-S6 kinase (p70S6K) by regulating the expression of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and p38 involved mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway.

Despite its widespread use as a prototype for drug development and a subtype-selective tool for physiologic experiments, its precise effect on GluN1/GluN2B gating is yet to be fully understood. Interestingly, recent crystallographic evidence identified that ifenprodil, unlike zinc, binds at the interface of the GluN1/GluN2B amino terminal domain dimer by an induced-fit mechanism. To delineate the effect of this unique binding on GluN1/GluN2B receptor gating, we recorded steady-state currents from cell-attached and outside-out patches. At pH 7.9 in cell-attached patches, ifenprodil increased the occupancy of the long-lived shut conformations, thereby reducing the open probability of the receptor with no change in the mean open time. In addition, ifenprodil selectively affected the area of shut time constants, but not the time constants themselves. Kinetic analyses suggested that ifenprodil prevents the transition of the receptor to an open state and increases its dwell time in an intrinsically occurring closed conformation or desensitized state. We found distinct differences in the action of ifenprodil at GluN1/GluN2B in comparison with previous studies on the effect of zinc on GluN1/GluN2A gating, which may arise due to their unique binding sites. Our data also uncover the potential pH-dependent action of ifenprodil on gating. At a low pH (pH 7.4), but not pH 7.9, ifenprodil reduces the mean open time of GluN1/GluN2B receptors, which may be responsible for its usefulness as a context-dependent inhibitor in conditions like ischemia and stroke, when the pH of the extracellular milieu becomes acidic.",

However, cytological assay using apoptotic and necrotic markers resulted in that apoptosis, but not necrosis, was significantly induced in Neuro-2a cells when NaAsO(2) exposure continued after the significant effects of NaAsO(2) on neurite outgrowth were found by live imaging. These results suggested that neurite outgrowth was suppressed by NaAsO(2) prior to NaAsO(2)-induced apoptosis. Next, we examined the effects of NaAsO(2) on cytoskeletal gene expression in Neuro-2a cells. NaAsO(2) increased the mRNA levels of the light and medium subunits of neurofilament and decreased the mRNA levels of tau and tubulin in a dose-dependent manner; no significant effect was found in the mRNA levels of the heavy subunit of neurofilament, microtubule-associated protein 2, or actin. The changes in cytoskeletal gene expression are likely responsible for the inhibitory effects of NaAsO(2) on neurite outgrowth.",

However, it also shows substantial anti-cancer activity in individuals with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Unfortunately, As(2)O(3)-treated leukemia patients suffer hepatotoxicity. Resveratrol has been demonstrated to have efficient antioxidant and antineoplastic activities. The study that how As(2)O(3) in combination with resveratrol affects hepatotoxicity and arsenic accumulation in the liver is lacking, and the present study tackles this question. Wistar rats were injected with 3mg/kg As(2)O(3) on alternate days; resveratrol (8mg/kg) was administered 1h before As(2)O(3). Rats were killed on the 8th day to determine histological liver damage, the antioxidant enzymes in serum, the ratio of reduced glutathione (GSH) to oxidized glutathione (GSSG), and arsenic accumulation in the liver. In the resveratrol+As(2)O(3) group, activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase in serum and GSH/GSSG were significantly increased, histopathological effects were reduced, and arsenic accumulation markedly decreased in the liver, compared with the As(2)O(3)-treated group. Thus, resveratrol attenuated As(2)O(3)-induced hepatotoxicity by decreasing oxidative stress and arsenic accumulation in the liver. These data suggest that use of resveratrol as post-remission therapy of APL and adjunctive therapy in patients with chronic exposure to arsenic may decrease arsenic hepatotoxicity.",

Treatment with DBDCT resulted in a dose- and time-dependent growth inhibition of PC12 cells. The changes in cell morphology were observed using light microscopy, fluorescence microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. PC12 cell apoptosis induced by DBDCT was confirmed by annexin V/propidium iodide staining, and characterized by cleavage of caspase-9 and caspase-3 proteins. DBDCT induced the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytosol and the generation of reactive oxygen species. DBDCT up-regulated the expression of Bax, down-regulated the expression of Bcl-2, and significantly increased the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2. DBDCT also caused the phosphorylation of JNK and p38(MAPK). In rats exposed to DBDCT, apoptosis was also observed in brain, as shown by the detection of cleaved caspase-9 and caspase-3 proteins and increased TUNEL positive staining.

In this study, we assessed whether CYP2E1 could influence the catalytic activity of CYP2B4 under steady-state turnover conditions. The results show that CYP2E1 inhibits CYP2B4-mediated metabolism of benzphetamine (BNZ) with a K(i) of 0.04 \u00b5M. However, CYP2B4 is not an inhibitor of CYP2E1-mediated p-nitrophenol hydroxylation. When these inhibition studies were performed with the artificial oxidant tert-butyl hydroperoxide, CYP2E1 did not significantly inhibit CYP2B4 activity. Determinations of the apparent K(M) and k(cat) of CYP2B4 for CPR in the presence of increasing concentrations of CYP2E1 revealed a mixed inhibition of CYP2B4 by CYP2E1. At low concentrations of CYP2E1, the apparent K(M) of CYP2B4 for CPR increased up to 23-fold with virtually no change in the k(cat) for the reaction, however, at higher concentrations of CYP2E1, the apparent K(M) of CYP2B4 for CPR decreased to levels similar to those observed in the absence of CYP2E1 and the k(cat) also decreased by 11-fold. Additionally, CYP2E1 increased the apparent K(M) of CYP2B4 for BNZ by 8-fold and the apparent K(M) did not decrease to its original value when saturating concentrations of CPR were used. While the individual apparent K(M) values of CYP2B4 and CYP2E1 for CPR are similar, the apparent K(M) of CYP2E1 for CPR in the presence of CYP2B4 decreased significantly, thus suggesting that CYP2B4 enhances the affinity of CYP2E1 for CPR and this may allow CYP2E1 to out-compete CYP2B4 for CPR.",

        "input": "Using paraoxon as a reference acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor, the objective of this study was to develop an adverse outcome pathway (AOP) that provided quantitative linkages across levels of biological organization during zebrafish embryogenesis. Within normal zebrafish embryos, we first demonstrated that ache transcripts and AChE activity increased in a stage-dependent manner following segmentation. We then showed that static exposure of embryos to paraoxon (31.2-500 nM) from 5 to 96 hpf resulted in significant stage- and concentration-dependent AChE inhibition, albeit these effects were fully reversible within 48 h following transfer to clean water. However, even in the presence of significant AChE inhibition, exposure to non-teratogenic paraoxon concentrations (\u2264250 nM) did not adversely impact secondary motoneuron development at 96 hpf. Therefore, we investigated the potential effects of paraoxon exposure on spontaneous tail contractions at 26 hpf - an early locomotor behavior that results from innervation of primary (not secondary) motoneuron axons to target axial muscles. Based on these studies, the frequency of spontaneous tail contractions at 26 hpf - a developmental stage with minimal AChE expression and activity - was significantly higher following exposure to paraoxon concentrations as low as 31.2 nM. Overall, our data suggest that (1) normal AChE activity is not required for secondary motoneuron development and (2) spontaneous tail contractions at 26 hpf are sensitive to paraoxon exposure, an effect that may be independent of AChE inhibition. Using a well-studied reference chemical, this study highlights the potential challenges in developing quantitative AOPs to support chemical screening and prioritization strategies.",

The present study was designed to determine the effects of artemisinic acid on melanogenesis and its mechanisms of action in human epidermal melanocytes. In this study, we found that artemisinic acid inhibited melanin content. The mRNA levels of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) and its downstream genes tyrosinase, tyrosinase-related protein (TRP)-1, and TRP-2 were reduced by artemisinic acid treatment. Additionally, the mRNA levels of melanogenesis-related genes (c-KIT, stem cell factor (SCF), and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF)) were down-regulated by artemisinic acid. Furthermore, cAMP production and protein kinase A (PKA) activity were suppressed by artemisinic acid. Moreover, attempts to elucidate a possible mechanism underlying the artemisinic acid-mediated effects revealed that artemisinic acid regulated melanogenesis by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis through downregulation of the hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA (HMG CoA) reductase gene, which was mediated through reduced expression of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) \u03b1 gene. Taken together, these findings indicate that the inhibition of melanogenesis by artemisinic acid occurs through reduced expression of the HMG CoA reductase gene, which is mediated by C/EBP \u03b1 inhibition and suggest that artemisinic acid may be useful as a hyperpigmentation inhibitor.",

We examined the ability of the EPAC-selective cAMP analog 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM to potentiate the action of these drugs and the mechanism that might account for it. Insulin secretion stimulated by both 200 \u03bcM tolbutamide and 20 \u03bcM gliclazide, concentrations that had equivalent effects on membrane potential, was inhibited by thapsigargin (1 \u03bcM) or the L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker nicardipine (2 \u03bcM) and was potentiated by 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM at concentrations \u22652 \u03bcM in INS-1 cells. Ca(2+) transients stimulated by either tolbutamide or gliclazide were inhibited by thapsigargin or nicardipine and were significantly potentiated by 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM at 5 \u03bcM but not 1 \u03bcM. Both tolbutamide and gliclazide stimulated phospholipase C activity; however, only gliclazide did so independently of its activity at K(ATP) channels, and this activity was partially inhibited by pertussis toxin. 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM alone (5 \u03bcM) did not stimulate insulin secretion, but did increase intracellular Ca(2+) concentration significantly, and this activity was inhibited by 25 \u03bcM 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborate (2-APB) or the removal of extracellular Ca(2+). 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM potentiation of insulin secretion stimulated by tolbutamide was markedly inhibited by 2-APB (25 \u03bcM) and enhanced by the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I (1 \u03bcM). Our data demonstrate that the actions of both tolbutamide and gliclazide are strongly potentiated by 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM, that gliclazide can stimulate phospholipase C activity via a partially pertussis toxin-sensitive mechanism, and that 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM potentiation of tolbutamide action may involve activation of a 2-APB-sensitive Ca(2+) influx.",

In the present study, we investigated the regulation of connexin43 (Cx43) and Cx43-mediated gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) during the AhR-dependent disruption of contact inhibition in non-tumorigenic liver epithelial cells. The contact inhibition of cell proliferation is a process restricting the cell division of confluent non-transformed cells, which is frequently abolished in cancer cells; however, the mechanisms contributing to its disruption are still only partially understood. Disruption of contact inhibition, which was induced by toxic AhR ligands 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in epithelial WB-F344 cells, reduced Cx43 protein levels, possibly via enhanced proteasomal degradation, significantly decreased the amount of gap junction plaques and downregulated GJIC, in an AhR-dependent manner. Although both intracellular and membrane Cx43 pools were markedly reduced in cells released from contact inhibition by TCDD, siRNA-mediated Cx43 knock-down was not sufficient to stimulate proliferation in contact-inhibited cells. Our data suggest that downregulation of Cx43/GJIC in non-transformed epithelial cells is an inherent part of disruption of contact inhibition, which occurs at the post-transcriptional level. This process runs in parallel with alterations of other forms of cell-to-cell communication, thus suggesting that toxic AhR agonists may simultaneously abrogate contact inhibition and reduce GJIC, two essential mechanisms linked to deregulation of cell-to-cell communication during tumor promotion and progression.",

These channels contribute to the cellular excitability of smooth muscle cells and hence regulate the motility patterns in the colon. Whole-cell voltage-clamp techniques were used to study the alterations in K(ATP) channels in smooth muscle cells in experimental colitis. Colonic inflammation was induced in BALB/C mice after intracolonic administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid. K(ATP) currents were measured at a holding potential of -60 mV in high K(+) external solution. The concentration response to levcromakalim (LEVC), a K(ATP) channel opener, was significantly shifted to the left in the inflamed smooth-muscle cells. Both the potency and maximal currents induced by LEVC were enhanced in inflammation. The EC(50) values in control were 6259 nM (n = 10) and 422 nM (n = 8) in inflamed colon, and the maximal currents were 9.9 \u00b1 0.71 pA/pF (60 \u03bcM) in control and 39.7 \u00b1 8.8 pA/pF (3 \u03bcM) after inflammation. As was seen with LEVC, the potency and efficacy of sodium hydrogen sulfide (NaHS) (10-1000 \u03bcM) on K(ATP) currents were significantly greater in inflamed colon compared with controls. In control cells, pretreatment with 100 \u00b5M NaHS shifted the EC(50) for LEV-induced currents from 2838 (n = 6) to 154 (n = 8) nM.

RA at 10, 25 and 50mg/kg was administered by gavage once daily for 2 consecutive days, 6h after CCl(4) intoxication. CCl(4) intoxication caused hepatic necrosis and increased serum ALT activity. In the livers, oxidative/nitrosative stress was evidenced by increased 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) formation and a significant decrease in Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. CCl(4) administration triggered inflammatory response in mice livers by activating nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-\u03baB), which coincided with the induction of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). RA improved histological and serum markers of liver damage and significantly ameliorated oxidative/nitrosative stress and inflammatory response in liver tissue. Additionally, RA prevented transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-\u03b21) and alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) expression, suggesting suppression of profibrotic response. Furthermore, RA significantly inhibited the CCl(4)-induced apoptosis, which was evident from decreased cleavage of caspase-3. The hepatoprotective activity of RA coincided with enhanced NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression.

        "input": "(-)-Epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG), a polyphenol extracted from green tea, has been proposed as an effective compound for improving cardiac contractility. However, the therapeutic potential of ECG on the treatment of arrhythmia remains unknown. We investigated the direct actions of ECG on the modulation of ion currents and cardiac cell excitability in the primary culture of neonatal rat ventricular myocyte (NRVM), which is considered a hypertrophic model for analysis of myocardial arrhythmias. By using the whole-cell patch-clamp configurations, we found ECG enhanced the slowly inactivating component of voltage-gated Na(+) currents (I(Na)) in a concentration-dependent manner (0.1-100 \u03bcM) with an EC(50) value of 3.8 \u03bcM. ECG not only shifted the current-voltage relationship of peak I(Na) to the hyperpolarizing direction but also accelerated I(Na) recovery kinetics. Working at a concentration level of I(Na) enhancement, ECG has no notable effect on voltage-gated K(+) currents and L-type Ca(2+) currents. With culture time increment, the firing rate of spontaneous action potential (sAP) in NRVMs was gradually decreased until spontaneous early after-depolarization (EAD) was observed after about one week culture. ECG increased the firing rate of normal sAP about two-fold without waveform alteration. Interestingly, the bradycardia-dependent EAD could be significantly restored by ECG in fast firing rate to normal sAP waveform. The expression of dominant cardiac sodium channel subunit, Nav1.5, was consistently detected throughout the culture periods. Our results reveal how ECG, the novel I(Na) agonist, may act as a promising candidate in clinical applications on cardiac arrhythmias.",

We found that phillyrin suppressed high glucose-induced lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells. Phillyrin strongly inhibited high glucose-induced fatty acid synthase (FAS) expression by modulating sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) activation. Moreover, use of the pharmacological AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibitor compound C revealed that AMPK is essential for suppressing SREBP-1c expression in phillyrin-treated cells. Finally, we found that liver kinase B1 (LKB1) phosphorylation is required for the phillyrin-enhanced activation of AMPK in HepG2 hepatocytes. These results indicate that phillyrin prevents lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells by blocking the expression of SREBP-1c and FAS through LKB1/AMPK activation, suggesting that phillyrin is a novel AMPK activator with a role in the prevention and treatment of obesity.",

        "input": "The neuropathologic mechanisms after exposure to lethal doses of nerve agent are complex and involve multiple biochemical pathways. Effective treatment requires drugs that can simultaneously protect by reversible binding to the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and blocking cascades of seizure related brain damage, inflammation, neuronal degeneration as well as promoting induction of neuroregeneration. [-]-Huperzine A ([-]-Hup A), is a naturally occurring potent reversible AChE inhibitor that penetrates the blood-brain barrier. It also has several neuroprotective effects including modification of beta-amyloid peptide, reduction of oxidative stress, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and induction and regulation of nerve growth factor. Toxicities at higher doses restrict the neuroporotective ability of [-]-Hup A for treatment. The synthetic stereoisomer, [+]-Hup A, is less toxic due to poor AChE inhibition and is suitable for both pre-/post-exposure treatments of nerve agent toxicity. [+]-Hup A block the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)-induced seizure in rats, reduce excitatory amino acid induced neurotoxicity and also prevent soman induced toxicity with minimum performance decrement. Unique combinations of two stereo-isomers of Hup A may provide an excellent pre/post-treatment drug for the nerve agent induced seizure/status epilepticus. We investigated a combination of [+]-Hup A with a small dose of [-]-Hup A ([+] and [-]-Hup A) against soman toxicity. Our data showed that pretreatment with a combination [+] and [-]-Hup A significantly increased the survival rate and reduced behavioral abnormalities after exposure to 1.2\u00d7LD50 soman compared to [+]-Hup A in guinea pigs. In addition, [+] and [-]-Hup A pretreatment inhibited the development of high power of EEG better than [+]-Hup A pretreatment alone. These data suggest that a combination of [+] and [-]-Hup A offers better protection than [+]-Hup A and serves as a potent medical countermeasure against lethal dose nerve agent toxicity in guinea pigs.",

Its biogenesis requires concerted expression of mitochondria- and nuclear-encoded subunits and assembly factors. In this report, we describe a homozygous missense mutation in FAM36A from a patient who displays ataxia and muscle hypotonia. The FAM36A gene is a remote, putative ortholog of the fungal complex IV assembly factor COX20. Messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein co-expression analyses support the involvement of FAM36A in complex IV function in mammals. The c.154A>C mutation in the FAM36A gene, a mutation that is absent in sequenced exomes, leads to a reduced activity and lower levels of complex IV and its protein subunits. The FAM36A protein is nearly absent in patient's fibroblasts. Cells affected by the mutation accumulate subassemblies of complex IV that contain COX1 but are almost devoid of COX2 protein. We observe co-purification of FAM36A and COX2 proteins, supporting that the FAM36A defect hampers the early step of complex IV assembly at the incorporation of the COX2 subunit. Lentiviral complementation of patient's fibroblasts with wild-type FAM36A increases the complex IV activity as well as the amount of holocomplex IV and of individual subunits. These results establish the function of the human gene FAM36A/COX20 in complex IV assembly and support a causal role of the gene in complex IV deficiency.",

Response to imatinib mainly depends from KIT and PDGFR\u03b1 mutational status. Nevertheless, some patients with a potentially responsive genotype do not respond, and others develop a pattern of resistance to imatinib which is not associated with secondary mutations. This emphasizes the presence of mechanisms of resistance other than the receptor-related genotype, and the need of biological predictors to select the optimal therapeutic strategy, particularly now that other potent inhibitors are available. We investigated a panel of 31 polymorphisms in 11 genes, potentially associated with the pharmacogenetics of imatinib, in a group of 54 unresectable/metastatic GISTs treated with imatinib 400mg daily as first line therapy. Included in this analysis were polymorphisms in the transporters' family SLC22, SLCO, ABC, and in the metabolizing genes CYP-3A4 and -3A5. Time to progression was significantly improved in presence of the C allele in SLC22A4 (OCTN1 rs1050152), and the two minor alleles (G) in SLC22A5 (OCTN2 rs2631367 and rs2631372). Importantly, multivariate analysis, adjusting for age, gender, KIT/PDGFR\u03b1 mutational status, and tumour size, revealed that all the three genotypes maintained independent predictive significance. In conclusion, in this study we showed that SLC22A4 and SLC22A5 genotypes may be an important predictor of time to progression in GIST patients receiving imatinib therapy.

When the orthosteric ligand pocket located in the transmembrane (TM) domain is occupied, ligand-specific conformational changes occur in the ECL2. In more than 90% of G protein-coupled receptors, ECL2 is tethered to the third TM helix via a disulfide bond. Therefore, understanding the extent to which the TM domain and ECL2 conformations are coupled is useful. To investigate this, we examined conformational changes in ECL2 of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) by introducing mutations in distant sites that alter the activation state equilibrium of the AT1R. Differential accessibility of reporter cysteines introduced at four conformation-sensitive sites in ECL2 of these mutants was measured. Binding of the agonist angiotensin II (AngII) and inverse agonist losartan in wild-type AT1R changed the accessibility of reporter cysteines, and the pattern was consistent with ligand-specific \"lid\" conformations of ECL2. Without agonist stimulation, the ECL2 in the gain of function mutant N111G assumed a lid conformation similar to AngII-bound wild-type AT1R. In the presence of inverse agonists, the conformation of ECL2 in the N111G mutant was similar to the inactive state of wild-type AT1R. In contrast, AngII did not induce a lid conformation in ECL2 in the loss of function D281A mutant, which is consistent with the reduced AngII binding affinity in this mutant. However, a lid conformation was induced by [Sar(1),Gln(2),Ile(8)] AngII, a specific analog that binds to the D281A mutant with better affinity than AngII.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of TCDD administered to pregnant mice at two different doses (2-10 ng/kg/day), on imprinted genes in the male offspring. The degree of methylation and the mRNA expression of Snrpn, Peg3 and Igf2r were analyzed in the sperm, skeletal muscle and liver. TCDD administration (10 ng/kg/day) decreased the sperm count in the male offspring. It did not affect methylation but increased mRNA expression of Snrpn, Peg3, Igf2r and Air ncRNA. In muscle and liver, TCDD (10 ng/kg/day) induced increases in methylation and decreases in mRNA expression of Igf2r. These results show that the robust effects of TCDD on the mRNA expression of Snrpn, Peg3 and Igf2r genes in the sperm and of Igf2r in the muscle and liver are unrelated to changes in methylation in their respective genes.",

The inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase using Ly294002 augmented a decrease in the p21 level induced by their combination, but it showed no significant effects on expression of Sp1 and cyclin D1.

        "input": "GABA type A receptors (GABA(A)-R) are important for ethanol actions and it is of interest to link individual subunits with specific ethanol behaviors. We studied null mutant mice for six different GABA(A)-R subunits (\u03b11, \u03b12, \u03b13, \u03b14, \u03b15 and \u03b4). Only mice lacking the \u03b12 subunit showed reduction of conditioned taste aversion (CTA) to ethanol. These results are in agreement with data from knock-in mice with mutation of the ethanol-sensitive site in the \u03b12-subunit (Blednov et\u00a0al., 2011). All together, they indicate that aversive property of ethanol is dependent on ethanol action on \u03b12-containing GABA(A)-R. Deletion of the \u03b12-subunit led to faster recovery whereas absence of the \u03b13-subunit slowed recovery from ethanol-induced incoordination (rotarod). Deletion of the other four subunits did not affect this behavior. Similar changes in this behavior for the \u03b12 and \u03b13 null mutants were found for flurazepam motor incoordination. However, no differences in recovery were found in motor-incoordinating effects of an \u03b11-selective modulator (zolpidem) or an \u03b14-selective agonist (gaboxadol). Therefore, recovery of rotarod incoordination is under control of two GABA(A)-R subunits: \u03b12 and \u03b13. For motor activity, \u03b13 null mice demonstrated higher activation by ethanol (1\u00a0g/kg) whereas both \u03b12 (-/-) and \u03b13 (-/Y) knockout mice were less sensitive to ethanol-induced reduction of motor activity (1.5\u00a0g/kg). These studies demonstrate that the effects of ethanol at GABAergic synapses containing \u03b12 subunit are important for specific behavioral effects of ethanol which may be relevant to the genetic linkage of the \u03b12 subunit with human alcoholism.",

Arsenic (As(III)) exposure may increase metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease risk by impairing adipose tissue differentiation, function, and insulin sensitivity through pathogenic mechanisms that remain unclear. We hypothesized that As(III) signals through the Pertussis toxin (Ptx) sensitive, Gi protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) to impair adipogenesis, as previously demonstrated for its stimulation of vascular oxidant generation, angiogenesis, and remodeling. Because both As(III) and GPCR ligands inhibit progenitor cell differentiation into adipocytes, we investigated the hypothesis in a model of low-passage human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC). As(III) (0.1-1.0 \u00b5M) suppressed dexamethasone/insulin-induced hMSC adipogenesis, as indicated by decreased transcriptional promoters of differentiation, decreased fat droplet formation, and decreased expression of differentiated adipocyte markers, such as adiponectin and perilipin. Preincubating hMSC with Ptx prevented 90% of the suppressive effect of As(III). Selective competitive antagonists of Gi-coupled endothelin-1 type A and B receptors were ~60% effective in blocking As(III) inhibition and combination of antagonists to both receptors were 85% effective. In contrast, antagonists to the sphingosine-1-phosphate type 1 receptor (previously shown to mediate As(III) vascular effects) or the angiotensin II type 1 receptor were ineffective in blocking As(III) effects. These studies suggest a majority of arsenic-inhibited adipocyte differentiation, and metabolism requires endothelin-1 GPCRs and that As(III) effects on GPCR signaling are tissue and context specific. This may represent a significant mechanism for the contribution of arsenic exposure to increased metabolic and cardiovascular diseases.",

Using normal human epidermal keratinocytes, we investigated the mechanism of TCDD-mediated enhancement of epidermal differentiation by integrating functional genomic, metabolomic, and biochemical analyses. TCDD increased the expression of 40% of the genes of the epidermal differentiation complex found on chromosome 1q21 and 75% of the genes required for de novo ceramide biosynthesis. Lipid analysis demonstrated that eight of the nine classes of ceramides were increased by TCDD, altering the ratio of ceramides to free fatty acids. TCDD decreased the expression of the glucose transporter, SLC2A1, and most of the glycolytic transcripts, followed by decreases in glycolytic intermediates, including pyruvate. NADH and Krebs cycle intermediates were decreased, whereas NAD(+) was increased. Mitochondrial glutathione (GSH) reductase activity and the GSH/glutathione disulfide ratio were decreased by TCDD, ultimately leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, characterized by decreased inner mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP production, and increased production of the reactive oxygen species (ROS), hydrogen peroxide. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) antagonists blocked the response of many transcripts to TCDD, and the endpoints of decreased ATP production and differentiation, suggesting regulation by the AHR. Cotreatment of cells with chemical antioxidants or the enzyme catalase blocked the TCDD-mediated acceleration of keratinocyte cornified envelope formation, an endpoint of terminal differentiation. Thus, TCDD-mediated ROS production is a critical step in the mechanism of this chemical to accelerate keratinocyte differentiation.",

In contrast to long-known IFN\u03b1/\u03b2, Interleukin (IL)-22 is an anti-bacterial, largely tissue protective cytokine that recently gained attention. Herein, cellular IFN\u03b1/IL-22 interactions are investigated.

Accordingly, only after IFN\u03b1 pre-incubation was IL-22-induced STAT1 binding to the CXCL10 promoter detectable. Using the viral mimic polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid and the IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 antagonist B18R we furthermore demonstrate the capability of endogenous IFN to promote IL-22-induced STAT1 activation and expression of CXCL10. IL-22-induced STAT1 activation subsequent to IFN\u03b1 priming became likewise apparent in human Caco2 colon epithelial/carcinoma cells, HepG2 hepatoma cells, and primary keratinocytes.

Albumin nanoparticles were surface-coated with bifunctional polyethylene glycol 3500 (PEG) and a nanobody-the single variable domain of an antibody-(Ega1) against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).

The intracellular routing of EGa1 targeted nanoparticles leads to a successful release of the kinase inhibitor in the cell and inhibition of proliferation whereas the non-targeted formulations had no antiproliferative effects on 14C cells.

In the present study, four forms of V. affinis phospholipase A(1) were identified through a proteomics approach. Two of these enzymes were purified by reverse-phase chromatography, and their biochemical properties were characterised. These enzymes, designated Ves a 1s, are not glycoproteins and exist as 33441.5 and 33474.4 Da proteins, which corresponded with the 34-kDa band observed via SDS-PAGE. The thermal stabilities of these enzymes were stronger than snake venom. Using an in vivo assay, no difference was found in the toxicities of the different isoforms. Furthermore, the toxicity of these enzymes does not appear to be correlated with their PLA(1) activity. The cDNAs of the full-length version of Ves a 1s revealed that the Ves a 1 gene consists of a 1005-bp ORF, which encodes 334 amino acid residues, and 67- and 227-bp 5' and 3' UTRs, respectively. The two isoforms are different by three nucleotide substitutions, resulting in the replacement of two amino acids. Through sequence alignment, these enzymes were classified as members of the pancreatic lipase family. The structural modelling of Ves a 1 used the rat pancreatic lipase-related protein 2 (1bu8A) as a template because it has PLA(1) activity, which demonstrated that this enzyme belongs to the \u03b1/\u03b2 hydrolase fold family. The Ves a 1 structure, which is composed of seven \u03b1-helixes and eleven \u03b2-strands, contains the \u03b2-strand/\u025bSer/\u03b1-helix structural motif, which contains the Gly-X-Ser-X-Gly consensus sequence. The typical surface structures that play important roles in substrate selectivity (the lid domain and the \u03b29 loop) were shortened in the Ves a 1 structure, which suggests that this enzyme may only exhibit phospholipase activity. Moreover, the observed insertion of proline into the lid domain of the Ves a 1 structure is rare. We therefore propose that this proline residue might be involved in the stability and activity of Ves a 1s.",

Therefore, we investigated the involvement of endozepines in brain glucose sensing. First, we showed that intracerebroventricular administration of glucose in rats increases DBI expression in hypothalamic glial-like tanycytes. We then demonstrated that glucose stimulates endozepine secretion from hypothalamic explants. Feeding experiments indicate that the anorexigenic effect of central administration of glucose was blunted by coinjection of an ODN antagonist. Conversely, the hyperphagic response elicited by central glucoprivation was suppressed by an ODN agonist. The anorexigenic effects of centrally injected glucose or ODN agonist were suppressed by blockade of the melanocortin-3/4 receptors, suggesting that glucose sensing involves endozepinergic control of the melanocortin pathway. Finally, we found that brain endozepines modulate blood glucose levels, suggesting their involvement in a feedback loop controlling whole-body glucose homeostasis.

Our results showed that cinobufagin potently inhibited the proliferation of U2OS, MG63 and SaOS-2 cells. Significant increases in G2/M cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in OS cells were also observed. The expression levels of several apoptotic proteins were assessed after cinobufagin treatment in U2OS cells.

Furthermore, we validated the inhibition of GSK-3\u03b2/NF-\u03baB signaling following cinobufagin treatment. Western blots showed a decrease in nuclear p65 protein expression after exposure to different concentrations of cinobufagin, while the phosphorylation of GSK-3\u03b2 was simultaneously increased. Transduction with constitutively active forms of GSK-3\u03b2 could protect against the downregulation of p65 and upregulation of cleaved-PARP that are induced by cinobufagin treatment.

Since respiratory failure is the primary cause of death following acute OP poisoning, an inhaled BChE therapeutic could prove highly efficacious in preventing acute toxicity as well as the associated delayed neuropathy. To address this, studies have been performed in mice and macaques using Chinese Hamster Ovary cells (CHO)-derived recombinant (r) BChE delivered by the pulmonary route, to examine whether the deposition of both macaque (Ma) and human (Hu) rBChE administered as aerosols (aer) favored the creation and retention of an efficient protective \"pulmonary bioshield\" that could scavenge incoming (inhaled) OPs in situ thereby preventing entry into the circulation and inhibition of plasma BChE and AChE on red blood cells (RBC-AChE) and in cholinergic synapses. In contrast to parenteral delivery of rBChE, which currently requires posttranslational modification for good plasma stability, an unmodified aer-rBChE pretreatment given 1-40h prior to >1 LD50 of aer-paraoxon (Px) was able to prevent inhibition of circulating cholinesterase in a dose-dependent manner. These studies are the first to show protection by rBChE against a pesticide such as paraoxon when delivered directly into the lung and bode well for the use of a non-invasive and consumer friendly method of rHuBChE delivery as a human treatment to counteract OP toxicity.",

Heart rate (HR) and electrocardiogram (ECG) was monitored at approximately 24-h both after the 3rd exposure and the last (6th) exposure, and systolic blood pressure (SBP) was monitored at approximately 24-h after the 6th exposure. Biomarkers of systemic inflammation and injuries (CRP, IL-6, LDH, CK), heart oxidative stress (MDA, SOD) and endothelial function (ET-1, VEGF) were analyzed after the 6th exposure. Additionally, myocardial ultrastructural alterations were observed under transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for histopathological analyses. Results showed that PM(2.5) alone exposure could trigger the significant increase of CRP, MDA, CK, ET-1 and SBP and decrease of heart rate variability (HRV), a marker of cardiac autonomic nervous system (ANS) function. Ozone alone exposure in rats did not show significant alterations in any indicators. Ozone plus PM(2.5) exposure, however, induced CRP, IL-6, CK, LDH and MDA increase, SOD and HRV decrease significantly in a dose-response way. Meanwhile, abnormal ECG types were monitored in rats exposed to PM(2.5) with and without ozone and obvious myocardial ultrastructural changes were observed by TEM. In conclusion, PM(2.5) alone exposure could cause inflammation, endothelial function and ANS injuries, and ozone potentiated these effects induced by PM(2.5).",

In several other cell lineages, insulin is able to stimulate p21-activated protein kinase 1 (Pak1). Here we determined the role of Pak1 in gcg expression and the effect of Pak1 deletion on glucose homeostasis. Insulin stimulated Pak1 activation through increasing its Thr423 phosphorylation in gut gcg-expressing cell lines, associated with increased gcg mRNA levels. This stimulation was attenuated by the Pak inhibitor 2,2'-dihydroxy-1,1'-dinaphthyldisulfide (IPA3) or dominant-negative Pak1. Both insulin and cAMP-promoting agents activated \u03b2-cat Ser675 phosphorylation, which was attenuated by IPA3 or protein kinase A inhibition, respectively. Gut gcg levels were reduced in male Pak1(-/-) mice, associated with impaired glucose tolerance after an ip or oral glucose challenge. These mice had lower circulating active GLP-1 levels after a glucose challenge as well as reduced distal ileum GLP-1 content after insulin treatment. Finally, the Pak1(-/-) mice exhibited reduced brainstem gcg level and abolished \u03b2-cat Ser675 phosphorylation in brain neurons after insulin treatment. We suggest that Pak1 mediates the cross talk between insulin and Wnt signaling pathways on gut and brain gcg expression, and its ablation impairs glucose homeostasis.",

        "input": "Leukocyte adhesion during inflammation is initiated by the binding of sialofucosylated carbohydrates expressed on leukocytes to endothelial E/P-selectin. Although the glycosyltransferases (glycoTs) constructing selectin-ligands have largely been identified using knock-out mice, important differences may exist between humans and mice. To address this, we developed a systematic lentivirus-based shRNA delivery workflow to create human leukocytic HL-60 cell lines that lack up to three glycoTs. Using this, the contributions of all three myeloid \u03b11,3-fucosyltransferases (FUT4, FUT7, and FUT9) to selectin-ligand biosynthesis were evaluated. The cell adhesion properties of these modified cells to L-, E-, and P-selectin under hydrodynamic shear were compared with bone marrow-derived neutrophils from Fut4(-/-)Fut7(-/-) dual knock-out mice. Results demonstrate that predominantly FUT7, and to a lesser extent FUT4, forms the selectin-ligand at the N terminus of leukocyte P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) in humans and mice. Here, 85% reduction in leukocyte interaction was observed in human FUT4(-)7(-) dual knockdowns on P/L-selectin substrates. Unlike Fut4(-/-)Fut7(-/-) mouse neutrophils, however, human knockdowns lacking FUT4 and FUT7 only exhibited partial reduction in rolling interaction on E-selectin. In this case, the third \u03b11,3-fucosyltransferase FUT9 played an important role because leukocyte adhesion was reduced by 50-60% in FUT9-HL-60, 70-80% in dual knockdown FUT7(-)9(-) cells, and \u223c85% in FUT4(-)7(-)9(-) triple knockdowns. Gene silencing results are in agreement with gain-of-function experiments where all three fucosyltransferases conferred E-selectin-mediated rolling in HEK293T cells. This study advances new tools to study human glycoT function. It suggests a species-specific role for FUT9 during the biosynthesis of human E-selectin ligands.",

        "input": "Ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine or MDMA) is a widely abused recreational drug, reported to produce neurotoxic effects, both in laboratory animals and in humans. MDMA metabolites can be major contributors for MDMA neurotoxicity. This work studied the neurotoxicity of MDMA and its catechol metabolites, \u03b1-methyldopamine (\u03b1-MeDA) and N-methyl-\u03b1-methyldopamine (N-Me-\u03b1-MeDA) in human dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells differentiated with retinoic acid and 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate. Differentiation led to SH-SY5Y neurons with higher ability to accumulate dopamine and higher resistance towards dopamine neurotoxicity. MDMA catechol metabolites were neurotoxic to SH-SY5Y neurons, leading to caspase 3-independent cell death in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. MDMA did not show a concentration- and time-dependent death. Pre-treatment with the antioxidant and glutathione precursor, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), resulted in strong protection against the MDMA metabolites' neurotoxicity. Neither the superoxide radical scavenger, tiron, nor the inhibitor of the dopamine (DA) transporter, GBR 12909, prevented the metabolites' toxicity. Cells exposed to \u03b1-MeDA showed an increase in intracellular glutathione (GSH) levels, which, at the 48 h time-point, was not dependent in the activity increase of \u03b3-glutamylcysteine synthetase (\u03b3-GCS), revealing a possible transient effect. Importantly, pre-treatment with buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), an inhibitor of \u03b3-GCS, prevented \u03b1-MeDA induced increase in GSH levels, but did not augment this metabolite cytotoxicity. Even so, BSO pre-treatment abolished NAC protective effects against \u03b1-MeDA neurotoxicity, which were, at least partially, due to GSH de novo synthesis. Inversely, pre-treatment of cells with BSO augmented N-Me-\u03b1-MeDA-induced neurotoxicity, but only slightly affected NAC neuroprotection. In conclusion, MDMA catechol metabolites promote differential toxic effects to differentiated dopaminergic human SH-SY5Y cells.",

POLQ has been implicated by different experiments to play a role in resistance to ionizing radiation and defense against genomic instability, in base excision repair, and in immunological diversification. The protein is formed by an N-terminal helicase-like domain, a C-terminal DNA polymerase domain, and a large central domain that spans between the two. This arrangement is also found in the Drosophila Mus308 protein, which functions in resistance to DNA interstrand crosslinking agents. Homologs of POLQ and Mus308 are found in multicellular eukaryotes, including plants, but a comparison of phenotypes suggests that not all of these genes are functional orthologs. Flies defective in Mus308 are sensitive to DNA interstrand crosslinking agents, while mammalian cells defective in POLQ are primarily sensitive to DNA double-strand breaking agents. Cells from Polq(-/-) mice are hypersensitive to radiation and peripheral blood cells display increased spontaneous and ionizing radiation-induced levels of micronuclei (a hallmark of gross chromosomal aberrations), though mice apparently develop normally. Loss of POLQ in human and mouse cells causes sensitivity to ionizing radiation and other double strand breaking agents and increased DNA damage signaling. Retrospective studies of clinical samples show that higher levels of POLQ gene expression in breast and colorectal cancer are correlated with poorer outcomes for patients. A clear understanding of the mechanism of action and physiologic function of POLQ in the cell is likely to bear clinical relevance.",

The drug therapy of intoxication with OPC includes mainly combination of cholinesterase (ChE) reactivators and cholinolytics.

Uptake of phenformin into isolated rat liver mitochondria was higher than that into heart mitochondria. It was inhibited by several cat ionic compounds, which suggests the involvement of multispecific transport system(s). Similar characteristics were also observed for uptake of TEA; however, uptake of phenformin into mitochondria of organic cation/carnitine transporter 1 (OCTN1) knockout mice was lower than that in wild-type mice, whereas uptake of TEA was comparable between the two strains, suggesting the involvement of distinct transport mechanisms for these two cations in mitochondria. Inhibition by phenformin of oxygen consumption via complex I respiration in isolated rat liver mitochondria was greater than that in heart mitochondria, whereas inhibitory effect of phenformin on complex I respiration was similar in inside-out structured submitochondrial particles prepared from rat livers and hearts. Lactic acidosis provoked by iv infusion of phenformin was weaker in octn1(-/-) mice than that in wild-type mice.

Sodium channel blockers currently used to treat neuropathic pain are poorly tolerated. Getting new molecules to clinical use is laborious. We here propose a drug already marketed as anticonvulsant, rufinamide. METHODS: We compared the behavioral effect of rufinamide to amitriptyline using the Spared Nerve Injury neuropathic pain model in mice. We compared the effect of rufinamide on sodium currents using in vitro patch clamp in cells expressing the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.7 isoform and on dissociated dorsal root ganglion neurons to amitriptyline and mexiletine. RESULTS: In naive mice, amitriptyline (20 mg/kg) increased withdrawal threshold to mechanical stimulation from 1.3 (0.6-1.9) (median [95% CI]) to 2.3 g (2.2-2.5) and latency of withdrawal to heat stimulation from 13.1 (10.4-15.5) to 30.0 s (21.8-31.9), whereas rufinamide had no effect. Rufinamide and amitriptyline alleviated injury-induced mechanical allodynia for 4 h (maximal effect: 0.10 +/- 0.03 g (mean +/- SD) to 1.99 +/- 0.26 g for rufinamide and 0.25 +/- 0.22 g to 1.92 +/- 0.85 g for amitriptyline). All drugs reduced peak current and stabilized the inactivated state of voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.7, with similar effects in dorsal root ganglion neurons. CONCLUSIONS: At doses alleviating neuropathic pain, amitriptyline showed alteration of behavioral response possibly related to either alteration of basal pain sensitivity or sedative effect or both. Side-effects and drug tolerance/compliance are major problems with drugs such as amitriptyline. Rufinamide seems to have a better tolerability profile and could be a new alternative to explore for the treatment of neuropathic pain.",

        "input": "OBJECTIVE Impaired insulin sensitivity increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. Although calorie restriction and weight loss increase insulin sensitivity, the effects of modifying macronutrient composition on insulin sensitivity are uncertain. The purpose of this study is to determine the effects on insulin sensitivity of a carbohydrate-rich diet (CARB; similar to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension [DASH] diet), a protein-rich diet (PROT; protein predominantly from plant sources), and an unsaturated fat-rich diet (UNSAT; predominantly monounsaturated). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This study was a randomized, controlled, three-period, crossover feeding study. The study participants were 164 individuals with prehypertension or stage 1 hypertension without diabetes. Diets were administered for 6 weeks each, with a washout period between diets of 2-4 weeks. Weight was held constant throughout the study. For our primary outcome, we calculated the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) using the end-of-period fasting serum glucose and insulin. QUICKI is a validated measure of insulin sensitivity. The primary analyses used generalized estimating equations. RESULTS At baseline, mean (SD) BMI was 30.2 (6.1) kg/m(2), and mean (SD) QUICKI was 0.35 (0.04). The UNSAT diet increased QUICKI by 0.005, more than the CARB diet (P = 0.04). PROT had no significant effect compared with CARB. CONCLUSIONS A diet that partially replaces carbohydrate with unsaturated fat may improve insulin sensitivity in a population at risk for cardiovascular disease. Given the well-recognized challenges of sustaining weight loss, our results suggest an alternative approach for improving insulin sensitivity.",

Although its effect is thought to be mediated, at least in part, by the induction of apoptosis, the underlying molecular mechanism remains elusive. Here, we identified Bcl-2 antagonist killer 1 (Bak) as a molecular target of VK2-induced apoptosis. VK2 directly interacts with Bak and induces mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis. Although Bak and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), another member of the Bcl-2 family, are generally thought to be functionally redundant, only Bak is necessary and sufficient for VK2-induced cytochrome c (cyt c) release and cell death. Moreover, VK2-2,3 epoxide, an intracellular metabolite of VK2, was shown to covalently bind to the cysteine-166 residue of Bak. Several lines of evidence suggested that the covalent attachment of VK2 is critical for apoptosis induction. Thus this study reveals a specific role for Bak in mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. This study also provides insight into the anticancer effects of VK2 and suggests that Bak may be a potential target of cancer therapy.",

In fact, genome-wide analyses that correlate histone marks with RNA processing signals raise the possibility that specific RNA processing factors may modulate transcription and help to \"write\" chromatin marks. Here we show that the nuclear cap binding complex (CBC) directs recruitment of transcription elongation factors and establishes proper histone marks during active transcription. A directed genetic screen revealed that deletion of either subunit of the CBC confers a synthetic growth defect when combined with deletion of genes encoding either Ctk2 or Bur2, a component of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ortholog of P-TEFb. The CBC physically associates with these complexes to recruit them during transcription and mediates phosphorylation at Ser-2 of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II. To understand how these interactions influence downstream events, histone H3K36me3 was examined, and we demonstrate that CBC\u0394 affects proper Set2-dependent H3K36me3. Consistent with this, the CBC and Set2 have similar effects on the ability to rapidly induce and sustain activated gene expression, and these effects are distinct from other histone methyltransferases. This work provides evidence for an emerging model that RNA processing factors can modulate the recruitment of transcription factors and influence histone modification during elongation.",

Oxyradical damage to phospholipids results in the production of reactive aldehydes that adduct proteins and modulate their function. 4-Hydroxynonenal (HNE), a common product of oxidative damage to lipids, adducts proteins at exposed Cys, His, or Lys residues. Here, we demonstrate that peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans-isomerase A1 (Pin1), an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of the peptide bond of pSer/pThr-Pro moieties in signaling proteins from cis to trans, is highly susceptible to HNE modification. Incubation of purified Pin1 with HNE followed by MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry resulted in detection of Michael adducts at the active site residues His-157 and Cys-113. Time and concentration dependencies indicate that Cys-113 is the primary site of HNE modification. Pin1 was adducted in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells treated with 8-alkynyl-HNE as judged by click chemistry conjugation with biotin followed by streptavidin-based pulldown and Western blotting with anti-Pin1 antibody. Furthermore, orbitrap MS data support the adduction of Cys-113 in the Pin1 active site upon HNE treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells. siRNA knockdown of Pin1 in MDA-MB-231 cells partially protected the cells from HNE-induced toxicity.

However, the investigation of estrogenic effects in males has been largely neglected. Therefore, we investigated the hippocampal gene expression of estrogen receptors \u03b1 and \u03b2 (ER\u03b1, \u03b2) in 8-week-old, 12-week-old and 24-week-old male rats. To control for possible interactions between the expression of the estrogen receptor genes and other learning-related steroid receptors, androgen receptors (AR), corticosterone-binding glucocorticoid receptors (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) were also measured. Furthermore, the concentrations of the ligands 17\u03b2-estradiol, testosterone and corticosterone were measured. The spatial training was conducted in a hole-board. The 8-week-old rats exhibited higher levels of general activity and exploration during the training and performed best with respect to spatial learning and memory, whereas no difference was found between the 12-week-old and 24-week-old rats. The trained 8-week-old rats exhibited increased gene expression of ER\u03b1 compared with the untrained rats in this age group as well as the trained 12-week-old and 24-week-old rats. The concentrations of estradiol and testosterone, however, were generally higher in the 24-week-old rats than in the 8-week-old and 12-week-old rats. The ER\u03b1 mRNA concentrations correlated positively with behavior that indicate general learning motivation. These results suggest a specific role of ER\u03b1 in the age-related differences in motivation and subsequent success in the task. Thus, estrogen and estrogenic functions may play a more prominent role in young male behavior and development than has been previously assumed.",

Race/ethnic differences in CYP2B6 genotype and phenotype were observed only in women. To identify important covariates associated with interindividual variation in CYP2B6 activity in vivo, we evaluated these effects in healthy volunteers using bupropion (Wellbutrin SR GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC) as a CYP2B6 probe substrate. A fixed 150-mg oral sustained-release dose of bupropion was administered to 100 healthy volunteers comprising four sex/ethnicity cohorts (n = 25 each): Caucasian men and Caucasian, African American, and Hispanic women. Blood samples were obtained at 0 and 6 hours postdose for the measurement of serum bupropion (BU) and hydroxybupropion (HB) concentrations. Whole blood was obtained at baseline for CYP2B6 genotyping. To characterize the relationship between CYP2B6 activity and ethnicity, sex, and genotype when accounting for serum BU concentrations (dose-adjusted log(10)-transformed), analysis of covariance model was fitted in which the dependent variable was CYP2B6 activity represented as the log(10)-transformed, metabolic ratio of HB to BU concentrations. Several CYP2B6 polymorphisms were associated with CYP2B6 activity. Evidence of dependence of CYP2B6 activity on ethnicity or genotype-by-ethnicity interactions was not detected in women. These results suggest that CYP2B6 genotype is the most important patient variable for predicting the level of CYP2B6 activity in women, when measured by the metabolism of bupropion. The bupropion metabolic ratio appears to detect known differences in CYP2B6 activity associated with genetic polymorphism, across different ethnic groups.

However, currently the hepatic differentiation of these cells relies on exposure to dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), which, as a side effect, has a cytotoxic effect and represses an all-round hepatic functionality. The AMC-bioartificial liver (AMC-BAL) is a three-dimensional bioreactor that has previously been shown to upregulate various liver functions of cultured cells. We therefore cultured HepaRG cells in the AMC-BAL without DMSO and characterized the drug metabolism. Within 14 days of culture, the HepaRG-AMC-BALs contained highly polarized viable liver-like tissue with heterogeneous expression of CYP3A4. We found a substantial metabolism of the tested substrates, ranging from 26% (UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1), 47% (CYP3A4), to 240% (CYP2C9) of primary human hepatocytes. The CYP3A4 activity could be induced 2-fold by rifampicin, whereas CYP2C9 activity remained equally high. The HepaRG-AMC-BAL secreted bile acids at 43% the rate of primary human hepatocytes and demonstrated hydroxylation, conjugation, and transport of bile salts. Concluding, culturing HepaRG cells in the AMC-BAL yields substantial phase 1 and phase 2 drug metabolism, while maintaining high viability, rendering DMSO addition superfluous for the promotion of drug metabolism. Therefore, AMC-BAL culturing makes the HepaRG cells more suitable for testing metabolism and toxicity of drugs.",

Long Evans dams were fed chow with or without added Pb acetate (0, 150, 375, 750 ppm) prior to breeding and remained on the same diet through weaning (perinatal exposure group). Other animals were exposed to the same doses of Pb but exposure started on postnatal day 1 and continued through weaning (early postnatal exposure group).

Western blot analyses showed significant effects of Pb exposure on DNMT1, DNMT3a, and MeCP2 expression, with effects often seen at the lowest level of exposure and modified by sex and developmental window of Pb exposure.

Mammalian ALDH1B1, another mitochondrial enzyme sharing 72% identity with ALDH2, is also capable of metabolizing acetaldehyde but has a tissue distribution and pattern of activity distinct from that of ALDH2. Bioinformatic analyses of several vertebrate genomes were undertaken using known ALDH2 and ALDH1B1 amino acid sequences. Phylogenetic analysis of many representative vertebrate species (including fish, amphibians, birds and mammals) indicated the presence of ALDH1B1 in many mammalian species and in frogs (Xenopus tropicalis); no evidence was found for ALDH1B1 in the genomes of birds, reptiles or fish. Predicted vertebrate ALDH2 and ALDH1B1 subunit sequences and structures were highly conserved, including residues previously shown to be involved in catalysis and coenzyme binding for human ALDH2. Studies of ALDH1B1 sequences supported the hypothesis that the ALDH1B1 gene originated in early vertebrates from a retrotransposition of the vertebrate ALDH2 gene. Given the high degree of similarity between ALDH2 and ALDH1B1, it is surprising that individuals with an inactivating mutation in ALDH2 (ALDH2*2) do not exhibit a compensatory increase in ALDH1B1 activity. We hypothesized that the similarity between the two ALDHs would allow for dominant negative heterotetramerization between the inactive ALDH2 mutants and ALDH1B1. Computational-based molecular modeling studies examining predicted protein-protein interactions indicated that heterotetramerization between ALDH2 and ALDH1B1 subunits was highly probable and may partially explain a lack of compensation by ALDH1B1 in ALDH2(\u2217)2 individuals.",

Dabrafenib is a BRAF (gene encoding serine/threonine-protein kinase B-Raf) inhibitor that has been developed to selectively target the valine 600 to glutamic acid substitution (BRAF(V600E)), which is commonly found in metastatic melanoma. Clinical trials with dabrafenib have shown encouraging results; however, the central nervous system distribution of dabrafenib remains unknown. Thus, the objective of the current study was to evaluate the brain distribution of dabrafenib in mice, and to see whether active efflux by P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) restricts its delivery across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In vitro accumulation studies conducted in Madin-Darby canine kidney II cells indicate that dabrafenib is an avid substrate for both P-gp and BCRP. Directional flux studies revealed greater transport in the basolateral to apical direction with corrected efflux ratios greater than 2 for both P-gp and Bcrp1 transfected cell lines. In vivo, the ratio of area under the concentration-time curve (AUC)(brain) to AUC(plasma) (K(p)) of dabrafenib after an i.v. dose (2.5 mg/kg) was 0.023, which increased by 18-fold in Mdr1 a/b(-/-)Bcrp1(-/-) mice to 0.42.

Further, compared with vemurafenib, another BRAF(V600E) inhibitor, dabrafenib showed greater brain penetration with a similar dose.

The role of follistatin in a wide range of biologic activities shows promise for potential clinical application, which has prompted considerable interest in the investigation of the protein as a potential disease-modifying agent. In spite of this potential, the development of follistatin as a broad use biotherapeutic has been severely hindered by a poor understanding and characterization of its pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationships. Therefore, to better define these relationships, we performed in-depth analyses of the PK/PD relationships of native follistatin-315 (FST315). Our data indicate that the intrinsic PK/PD properties of native FST315 are poorly suited for acting as a parentally administered biotherapeutic with broad systemic effects. Here, we leveraged protein engineering to modify the PK characteristics of the native molecule by fusing FST315 to a murine IgG(1) Fc and removing the intrinsic heparan sulfate-binding activity of follistatin. The engineered variant molecule had ~100- and ~1600-fold improvements in terminal half-life and exposure, respectively. In contrast to the native FST315, the variant showed a robust, dose-dependent pharmacological effect when administered subcutaneously on a weekly basis in mouse models of muscle atrophy and degeneration. These studies highlight the underappreciated and critical relationship between optimizing multiple physical and chemical properties of follistatin on its overall PK/PD profile.

Myeloperoxidase activity was detected by immunohistochemistry, and mRNA and protein expression levels of TLR4, NF-\u03baB, and IL-27 in colonic mucosa were detected by RT-PCR and Western blot. Compared with the untreated colitis group, the curcumin-treated group showed significant decreases in the disease activity index, colonic mucosa damage index, histological score, myeloperoxidase activity, and expressions of NF-\u03baB mRNA, IL-27 mRNA, TLR4 protein, NF-\u03baB p65 protein, and IL-27 p28 protein (p < 0.05).

In microdosing, use is made of accelerator MS (AMS). In this study, we investigated whether (129)I-labeling of proteins with subsequent AMS measurements is a suitable method to perform microdose studies with therapeutic proteins. We used erythropoietin (EPO) as a case study. RESULTS: In an animal study with (129)I-labeled EPO in Han-Wistar rats, an increase of (129)I-EPO is observed after dose administration. The half-life was found to be 2 and 5.5 h for two different EPOs. These results are in accordance with expected values. CoNCLUSION: Although further research is required, (129)I-labeling of proteins seems a feasible method for AMS microdose studies with peptide and protein drugs, such as biosimilars.",

        "input": "Kisspeptin is a 54-amino acid peptide which is encoded by the KiSS-1 gene and activates the G protein-coupled receptor GPR54. Evidence suggests that this system is a key regulator of mammalian and human reproduction. Animal studies have shown that GPR54-deficient mice have abnormal sexual development. Central and peripheral administration of kisspeptin stimulates the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis whilst pre-administration of a gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist abolishes this effect. In humans, inactivating GPR54 mutations cause normosmic hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism whilst activation of GPR54 signalling is associated with premature puberty. In healthy human volunteers, the acute intravenous administration of kisspeptin potently increases plasma luteinising hormone (LH) levels and significantly increases plasma follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and testosterone without side effects in both males and in females particularly in the preovulatatory phase of the menstrual cycle. In infertility due to hypothalamic amenorrhoea acute administration of kisspeptin results in stimulation of reproductive hormones. The kisspeptin/GPR54 system therefore appears to play an important role in the regulation of reproduction in humans. Hence kisspeptin has potential as a novel tool for the manipulation of the HPG axis and treatment of infertility in humans. This review discusses the evidence highlighting kisspeptin's key role in human reproduction.",

Therefore, downregulation of microglial activation has a significant therapeutic demand. In this study, focus was given to evaluate the ability of neoechinulin A, an indole alkaloid isolated from marine-derived Microsporum sp., to attenuate microglial activation by oligomeric amyloid-\u03b2 1-42 (A\u03b242). Neoechinulin A treatment significantly inhibited the generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in A\u03b242-activated BV-2 microglia cells. In addition, we found that neoechinulin A significantly suppressed the production of neurotoxic inflammatory mediator tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in activated BV-2 cells. Moreover, the treatment downregulated the protein and gene expressions of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6. Further, activated microglia-mediated apoptosis of PC-12 pheochromocytoma cells was significantly repressed by neoechinulin A. The molecular mechanism studies suggested that neoechinulin A may block the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) molecule p38, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK-1) and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) p65 and p50 subunits.

Concentration-dependent increases in rhythmic beating rate were noted at \u2264 6 h of treatment, followed by dose-dependent decreases after 6 and 72 h exposure. The toxic effects of jaspamide were compared with that of the known cardiotoxicant mitoxantrone, and confirmed by multiparameter fluorescence imaging analysis.

Ovarian progesterone induces and PG and IFNT stimulates endometrial HSD11B1 expression and keto-reductase activity as well as many epithelial genes that govern trophectoderm proliferation, migration, and attachment during elongation. The primary aim of these studies was to test the hypothesis that HSD11B1-derived cortisol has a biological role in endometrial function and conceptus development during early pregnancy in sheep. In study 1, cyclic ewes received vehicle, cortisol, PF 915275 (PF; a selective inhibitor of HSD11B1), cortisol and PF, meloxicam (a selective inhibitor of PTGS2), cortisol and meloxicam, recombinant ovine IFNT, or IFNT and PF into the uterus from day 10 to day14 after estrus. Cortisol and IFNT stimulated endometrial HSD11B1 expression and activity, increased endometrial PTGS2 activity and the amount of PG in the uterine lumen, and up-regulated many conceptus elongation-related genes in the endometrium. Some effects of cortisol and IFNT were mediated by PTGS2-derived PG. In study 2, bred ewes received PF 915275 or recombinant ovine IFNT and into the uterus from day 10 to day 14 after mating. Inhibition of HSD11B1 activity in utero prevented conceptus elongation, whereas IFNT rescued conceptus elongation in PF-infused ewes.

Although the groundnut extract by itself did not show antioxidative activity, it drove the antioxidative system in cells.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have linked polymorphisms in G6PC2 with variations in FBG and body fat, although not insulin sensitivity or glucose tolerance. G6PC2 encodes an islet-specific, endoplasmic reticulum-resident glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit. A combination of in situ perfused pancreas, in vitro isolated islet, and in vivo analyses were used to explore the function of G6pc2 in mice. G6pc2 deletion had little effect on insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, whereas body fat was reduced in female G6pc2 knockout (KO) mice on both a chow and high-fat diet, observations that are all consistent with human GWAS data. G6pc2 deletion resulted in a leftward shift in the dose-response curve for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). As a consequence, under fasting conditions in which plasma insulin levels were identical, blood glucose levels were reduced in G6pc2 KO mice, again consistent with human GWAS data. Glucose-6-phosphatase activity was reduced, whereas basal cytoplasmic calcium levels were elevated in islets isolated from G6pc2 KO mice. These data suggest that G6pc2 represents a novel, negative regulator of basal GSIS that acts by hydrolyzing glucose-6-phosphate, thereby reducing glycolytic flux.",

The sensitivity of pancreatic \u03b2-cells to oxidative stress has been attributed to their low content of antioxidants compared with other tissues. Bioactive compounds with potent antidiabetic properties have been shown to ameliorate hyperglycemia mediated oxidative stress. Recently, we have reported that oral administration of fisetin (10\u00a0mg/Kg b.w.), a bioflavonoid found to be present in strawberries, persimmon, to STZ-induced experimental diabetic rats significantly improved normoglycemia. The present study was aimed to evaluate the antioxidant potential of fisetin in both in vitro and in vivo. Diabetes was induced by single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (50\u00a0mg/kg body weight). Fisetin was administered orally for 30\u00a0days. At the end of the study, all animals were killed. Blood samples were collected for the biochemical estimations. The antioxidant status was evaluated. Histological examinations were performed on pancreatic tissues. Fisetin treatment showed a significant decline in the levels of blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), NF-kB p65 unit (in pancreas) and IL-1\u03b2 (plasma), serum nitric oxide (NO) with an elevation in plasma insulin. The treatment also improved the antioxidant status in pancreas as well as plasma of diabetic rats indicating the antioxidant potential of fisetin. In addition, the results of DPPH and ABTS assays substantiate the free radical scavenging activity of fisetin. Histological studies of the pancreas also evidenced the tissue protective nature of fisetin. It is concluded that, fisetin possesses antioxidant and anti-inflammatory property and may be considered as an adjunct for the treatment of diabetes.",

The present study characterizes intestinal transport of fluoride, using the Caco-2 cell line as a model of the intestinal epithelium, and evaluates the coefficients of apparent permeability and intracellular accumulation in various conditions (pH, temperature, opening of cell junctions, presence of anions). The results indicate that fluoride is an element with moderate absorption (<70%) in both directions (absorptive and secretory). Both in absorption (apical-basolateral) and in secretion (basolateral-apical) there is transport by the paracellular pathway, which may be considered predominant. Absorption and secretion of fluoride increase at acid pH levels, possibly because of its non-ionized state at these pHs and/or because of participation of a F(-)/H(+) cotransporter or a F(-)/OH(-) antiporter. The results also suggest transcellular participation of mechanisms involved in transport of Cl(-) and of an active transport in the secretory direction.

Here, we have determined the molecular mechanism of this male-specific activation of the Kcnk1 gene and characterized KCNK1 as a phenobarbital-inducible antihyperplasia factor. Upon activation by phenobarbital, nuclear receptor CAR binds the 97-bp response element (-2441/-2345) within the Kcnk1 promoter. This binding is observed in the livers of male mice, but not in the livers of female mice and requires the pituitary gland, because hypophysectomy abrogates it. Hyperplasia further progressed in the livers of Kcnk1 ( -/- ) male mice compared with those of Kcnk1 ( +/+ ) males after phenobarbital treatment. Thus, KCNK1 suppresses phenobarbital-induced hyperplasia. These results indicate that phenobarbital treatment induces KCNK1 to elicit a male-specific and growth-suppressing signal.

This family comprises proapoptotic and prosurvival proteins, and shifting the balance toward the latter is an established mechanism whereby cancer cells evade apoptosis.

However, concomitant on-target thrombocytopenia caused by BCL-X(L) inhibition limits the efficacy achievable with this agent. Here we report the re-engineering of navitoclax to create a highly potent, orally bioavailable and BCL-2-selective inhibitor, ABT-199. This compound inhibits the growth of BCL-2-dependent tumors in vivo and spares human platelets. A single dose of ABT-199 in three patients with refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia resulted in tumor lysis within 24 h.

(MEP) were studied using WP2, Ames (TA1535 and TA1537) and sister chromatid exchange (SCE) test systems. The results obtained from bacterial test systems demonstrated that MEP has strong antimutagenic potencies on TA1537 and WP2 strains. The highest inhibition rates for MEP on TA1537 and WP2 strains were 37.70% and 69.70%, respectively. According to the SCE test system, MEP reduced the genotoxic effects of aflatoxin. In order to clarify the mechanism underlying the antigenotoxic effects of MEP, the antioxidants were determined. Cotreatments of 5, 10 and 20 \u00b5g/mL concentrations of MEP with aflatoxin B(1) decreased the frequencies of SCE and the malondialdehyde level and increased amount of superoxide dismutase, glutathione and glutathione peroxidase which were decreased by aflatoxin. The data obtained from this work have clearly shown that MEP has significant antigenotoxic effects which are thought to be partly due to the antioxidant activities and antioxidant inducing capability of MEP.

It was found that atRA could protect hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells against cell death induced by serum starvation. Furthermore, it was found that atRA could enhance cell adhesion, but had no effect on the cell cycle and apoptosis. Using an Illumina Human HT-12 v4 expression microarray, 207 upregulated and 173 downregulated genes were identified in HepG2 cells treated with atRA. The most upregulated genes are cytochrome P450 family 26 subfamily A polypeptide 1 (CYP26A1), histidine triad nucleotide binding protein 3 (HINT3), miR-1282 and cytochrome P450 family 26 subfamily B polypeptide 1 (CYP26B1), which showed more than fivefold greater expression. Using Gene Ontology analysis, the greatest significance was found in extracellular-matrix-related molecular functions and the cellular component in upregulated genes. The upregulation of collagen 8A2 (COL8A2) was further confirmed using quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting. Knockdown of COL8A2 blocked enhancement in the early stage of cell adhesion by atRA treatment. Re-expression of COL8A2 in COL8A2-knocked-down HCC cells reversed the effect of small interfering RNA-COL8A2. In addition, COL8A2 could increase HCC cell migration and invasion. Thus, COL8A2 was identified as the key protein involved in the enhancement of cell adhesion of atRA under serum-free conditions. In conclusion, atRA protects HCC cells against serum-starvation-induced cell death by enhancing cell adhesion, and COL8A2 plays an important role in HCC cell migration and invasion.",

We aimed to establish the consequences of intranasal PGE2 administration on airway reactivity to aeroallergens in mice and reveal the underlying immunoinflammatory mechanisms. PGE2 was administered either daily during a 10-day exposure to house dust mite (HDM) extracts or for limited intervals. Airway hyperreactivity was measured by whole-body and invasive plethysmography. The phenotypes of lung immune cells and cytokine production were analysed by flow cytometry and ELISA, respectively. Airway hyperreactivity was sustainably reduced only when PGE2 administration was restricted to the initial 5 days of exposure to HDM. Lung inflammation, IL-4 production, and airway mast cell activity were also prevented under this early short-term treatment with PGE2. Interestingly, a Th2 response was already committed on day 5 of exposure to HDM. This was paralleled by GM-CSF and osteopontin upregulation and a decreased number of plasmacytoid dendritic and T regulatory cells, as well as a trend towards reduced IL-10 expression. Local PGE2 administration prevented the increase of airway IL-13 and osteopontin and kept lung plasmacytoid dendritic cell counts close to baseline. GM-CSF and Tregs were unaffected by the treatment. These findings suggest that the protection provided by PGE2 is a result of the modulation of early lung immunomodulatory mechanisms, and possibly a shift in the balance of dendritic cells towards a tolerogenic profile.",

The objectives of these studies were to explore the possibility of establishing of a link between the pharmacokinetics of TAK-441 and the responses of Gli1 mRNA in tumor-associated stromal or skin cells and the antitumor effect of hedgehog inhibition. To this end, we built pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models that describe the relationship of the concentrations of TAK-441 plasma to the responses of Gli1 mRNA in the tumor (target) and skin (surrogate) and to tumor growth inhibition in mice bearing xenografts of human pancreatic tumors (PAN-04). The responses of Gli1 mRNA and tumor growth were described by an indirect response model and an exponential tumor growth model, respectively. The IC50 values for Gli1 mRNA inhibition in the tumor and skin by TAK-441 were estimated to be 0.0457 and 0.113 \u03bcg/ml, respectively. The IC90 value for tumor growth inhibition was estimated to be 0.68 \u03bcg/ml. These results suggest that a >83% inhibition of Gli1 mRNA expression in the skin or a >94% inhibition of Gli1 mRNA expression in the tumor would be required to sufficiently inhibit (>90%) hedgehog-related tumor growth in the xenografted model mice.

Surface coating with methoxypoly(ethylene glycol)-based amphiphiles, which confers solubility and prolongs circulation profiles of CNTs, activates the complement system differently, depending on the amphiphile structure. CNTs with linear poly(ethylene glycol) amphiphiles trigger the lectin pathway of the complement through both L-ficolin and mannan-binding lectin recognition. The lectin pathway activation, however, did not trigger the amplification loop of the alternative pathway. An amphiphile with branched poly(ethylene glycol) architecture also activated the lectin pathway but only through L-ficolin recognition. Importantly, this mode of activation neither generated anaphylatoxins nor induced triggering of the effector arm of the complement system.

        "input": "Transcription factor NF-E2-related factor 2 (NRF2) plays a crucial role in the cellular defense against oxidative/electrophilic stress by up-regulating multiple antioxidant genes. Numerous studies with genetically modified animals have demonstrated that Nrf2 is a sensitivity determining factor upon the exposure to environmental chemicals including carcinogens. Moreover, recent studies have demonstrated that polymorphism in the human NRF2 promoter is associated with higher risks for developing acute lung injury, gastric mucosal inflammation, and nephritis. Therefore, the identification of reliable and effective human target genes of NRF2 may allow the monitoring of NRF2 activity and to predict individual sensitivity to environmental stress-induced damage. For this purpose, we investigated genes that are tightly controlled by NRF2 to establish markers for NRF2 activity in human cells. Firstly, in the normal human renal epithelial HK-2 cells, the measurement of the expression of 30 previously reported NRF2 target genes in response to NRF2 inducers (sulforaphane, tert-butylhydroquinone, cinnamic aldehyde, and hydrogen peroxide) showed that the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) 1C1 is highly inducible by all treatments. Accordantly, the basal and inducible expressions of AKRs were significantly attenuated in NRF2-silenced HK-2 cells. Whereas, cells with stable KEAP1 knockdown, which causes a modest NRF2 activation, demonstrated substantially increased levels of AKR1A1, 1B1, 1B10, 1C1, 1C2, and 1C3. Secondly, the linkage between NRF2 and the AKRs was confirmed in human monocytic leukemia cell line U937, which can be a model of peripherally available blood cells. The treatment of U937 cells with NRF2 inducers including sulforaphane effectively elevated the expression of AKR1B1, 1B10, 1C1, 1C2, and 1C3. Whereas, the levels of both the basal and sulforaphane-inducible expression of AKR1C1 were significantly reduced in NRF2-silenced stable U937 cells compared to the control cells. Similarly, the inducible expression of AKR1C1 was observed in another human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 as well as in human primary blood CD14(+) monocytes. In conclusion, together with the high inducibility and NRF2 dependency shown in renal epithelial cells as well as in peripherally available blood cells, current findings suggest that AKRs can be utilized as a marker of NRF2 activity in human cells.",

Post-translational modifications of TRF2 such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination, SUMOylation, methylation and poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation have been shown to play important roles in telomere function. Here we show that TRF2 specifically interacts with the histone acetyltransferase p300, and that p300 acetylates the lysine residue at position 293 of TRF2. We also report that p300-mediated acetylation stabilizes the TRF2 protein by inhibiting its ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis and is required for efficient telomere binding of TRF2. Furthermore, overexpression of the acetylation-deficient mutant, K293R, induces DNA-damage response foci at telomeres, thereby leading to induction of impaired cell growth, cellular senescence and altered cell cycle distribution. A small but significant number of metaphase chromosomes show no telomeric signals at chromatid ends, suggesting an aberrant telomere structure. These findings demonstrate that acetylation of TRF2 by p300 plays a crucial role in the maintenance of functional telomeres as well as in the regulation of the telomere-associated DNA-damage response, thus providing a new route for modulating telomere protection function.",

While PTE has been shown to have potent antitumor activity against various types of cancer, the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of PTE remain largely unknown. The Janus kinase 2/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (JAK2/STAT3) signaling pathway plays a crucial role in tumorigenesis and immune development. In this study, we assessed the antitumor activity of PTE against human osteosarcoma cells and explored the role of JAK2/STAT3 and apoptosis-related signaling pathways on the activity of PTE. PTE treatment resulted in a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of osteosarcoma cell viability. Additionally, PTE exhibited strong antitumor activity, as evidenced not only by reductions in tumor cell adhesion, migration and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) but also by increases in the apoptotic index, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and several biochemical parameters. Furthermore, PTE treatment directly inhibited the phosphorylation of JAK2 at Tyr 1007 and the downstream activation of STAT3. PTE also down-regulated the expression of STAT3 target genes, including the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, leading to the up-regulation of mitochondrial apoptosis pathway-related proteins (Bax, Bak, cytosolic Cytochrome c, and cleaved Caspase3) and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors such as p21 and p27. PTE, used in combination with a known JAK2/STAT3 inhibitor, AG490, further decreased the viability of osteosarcoma cells. Taken together, PTE is a potent inhibitor of osteosarcoma cell growth that targets the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. These data suggest that inhibition of JAK2/STAT3 signaling is a novel mechanism of action for PTE during therapeutic intervention in osteosarcoma cancers.",

The ability of dexamethasone, prednisolone and budesonide to affect the liver handling of bile acids (BAs) has been investigated. In rats treated with GCs for 4 days, altered serum and bile BA levels, changed conjugation pattern, and delayed and decreased ability to conjugate/secrete exogenously administered deoxycholate, were found using HPLC-MS/MS. RT-QPCR analyses revealed that GC treatment also induced a down-regulation of liver nuclear receptors (Fxr, Gr and Shp), transporters (Ntcp, Mrp4 and Bcrp) and enzymes (Cyp7a1 and Baat), whereas Bsep, Mrp2 and Cyp27a1 were up-regulated. Human HepG2 and Alexander cell lines were used as in vitro models of liver cells with and without constitutive FXR expression, respectively. In HepG2 cells, GCs induced a decreased expression of FXR and SHP, and inhibited the regulatory effect of GW4064 on FXR-target genes. In Alexander cells, only when they were transfected with FXR+RXR, GW4064 caused up-regulation of SHP and OST\u03b2, and a down-regulation of CYP27A1. GCs had the opposite effect on these genes, both in the absence and in the presence of FXR expression. Co-transfection of Alexander cells with IR-1-Luc and FXR+RXR revealed that GCs did not inhibit but moderately enhanced FXR activity. Moreover, GCs have a synergistic effect on GW4064-induced FXR activation, whereas chenodeoxycholate and GW4064 have an additive effect. In conclusion, GCs are able to directly or indirectly activate FXR but they also antagonize, through FXR-independent mechanisms, the expression of FXR and FXR target genes involved in the hepatic handling of BAs.",

Although dopaminergic neurons within the nigrostriatal pathway appear intact, Mn-induced irregularities in DA transmission have been observed including decreased amphetamine-induced DA release and loss of the dopamine transporter (DAT). Results of studies to evaluate the effect of Mn and DA on cell viability in control and DAT-transfected HEK cells reveal that Mn is equally toxic to both cell lines whereas DA was only toxic to cells containing DAT. DA toxicity was saturable suggesting that transport may be rate limiting. When Mn and DA were added simultaneously to the media, cell toxicity was similar to that produced by Mn alone suggesting that Mn may suppress DA uptake in the DAT containing cells. Preincubation of DA prior to the addition of Mn resulted in cell death which was essentially additive with that produced independently by the two agents. Mn was also shown to decrease DA uptake and amphetamine-induced DA efflux in DAT containing cells. Time-lapsed confocal microscopy indicates that Mn can promote trafficking of cell surface DAT into intracellular compartments which may account for the decrease in DA uptake and DA efflux in these cells. Mn-induced internalization of DAT may provide an explanation for disruption in DA transmission previously reported in the striatum.",

The current U.S. military and civilian oxime countermeasure, 2-[(hydroxyimino)methyl]-1-methylpyridin-1-ium chloride (2-PAM), is under consideration for replacement with a more effective acetylcholinesterase reactivator, 1,1'-methylenebis{4-hydroxyiminomethyl}pyridinium dimethanesulfonate (MMB-4). Kinetic data in the scientific literature for MMB-4 are limited; therefore, a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was developed for a structurally related oxime, 1,1'-trimethylenebis{4-hydroximinomethyl}pyridinium dibromide. Based on a previous model structure for the organophosphate diisopropylfluorophosphate, the model includes key sites of acetylcholinesterase inhibition (brain and diaphragm), as well as fat, kidney, liver, rapidly perfused tissues and slowly perfused tissues. All tissue compartments are diffusion limited. Model parameters were collected from the literature, predicted using quantitative structure-property relationships or, when necessary, fit to available pharmacokinetic data from the literature. The model was parameterized using rat plasma, tissue and urine time course data from intramuscular administration, as well as human blood and urine data from intravenous and intramuscular administration; sensitivity analyses were performed. The PBPK model successfully simulates rat and human data sets and has been evaluated by predicting intravenous mouse and intramuscular human data not used in the development of the model. Monte Carlo analyses were performed to quantify human population kinetic variability in the human evaluation data set. The model identifies potential pharmacokinetic differences between rodents and humans, indicated by differences in model parameters between species. The PBPK model can be used to optimize the dosing regimen to improve oxime therapeutic efficacy in a human population.",

SiO(2) NPs (concentration range 25-200\u00a0\u00b5g/ml) induced dose-dependent cytotoxicity in both types of cells, which was demonstrated by cell viability (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide) and lactate dehydrogenase leakage assays. SiO(2) NPs were also found to induce oxidative stress in a dose-dependent manner, indicated by depletion of glutathione and induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and lipid peroxidation. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that following the exposure of cells to SiO(2) NPs, the messenger RNA level of apoptotic genes (caspase-3 and caspase-9) were upregulated in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, activities of caspase-3 and caspase-9 enzymes were also significantly higher in both kinds of cells exposed to SiO(2) NPs.

The mouse CYP2J subfamily includes members that have wide tissue distribution and are active in the metabolism of arachidonic acid (AA), linoleic acid (LA), and other lipids and xenobiotics. The mouse Cyp2j locus contains seven genes and three pseudogenes located in a contiguous 0.62 megabase cluster on chromosome 4. We describe four new mouse CYP2J isoforms (designated CYP2J8, CYP2J11, CYP2J12, and CYP2J13). The four cDNAs contain open reading frames that encode polypeptides with 62-84% identity with the three previously identified mouse CYP2Js. All four new CYP2J proteins were expressed in Sf21 insect cells. Each recombinant protein metabolized AA and LA to epoxides and hydroxy derivatives. Specific antibodies, mRNA probes, and polymerase chain reaction primer sets were developed for each mouse CYP2J to examine their tissue distribution. CYP2J8 transcripts were found in the kidney, liver, and brain, and protein expression was confirmed in the kidney and brain (neuropil). CYP2J11 transcripts were most abundant in the kidney and heart, with protein detected primarily in the kidney (proximal convoluted tubules), liver, and heart (cardiomyocytes). CYP2J12 transcripts were prominently present in the brain, and CYP2J13 transcripts were detected in multiple tissues, with the highest expression in the kidney. CYP2J12 and CYP2J13 protein expression could not be determined because the antibodies developed were not immunospecific. We conclude that the four new CYP2J isoforms might be involved in the metabolism of AA and LA to bioactive lipids in mouse hepatic and extrahepatic tissues.",

Particularly MMP-2 and MMP-9 contribute to the degradation and reorganization of the ECM components and are involved in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular remodeling. Imbalanced MMP activity promotes vascular smooth muscle cells and migration and proliferation and endothelial dysfunction, thus resulting in increased cardiovascular stiffness and hypertrophy. Furthermore, MMP-2 cleaves non-ECM protein substrates including cellular receptors and intracellular proteins, thus causing cardiac and vascular dysfunction. It is now becoming clear that increased MMP activity promotes long-lasting cardiovascular structural and functional alterations in both experimental and clinical hypertension, and this alteration may contribute to sustained hypertension and its complications. Other pathogenic mechanisms including activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and oxidative stress activate and upregulate MMPs. Therefore, MMP inhibition may prevent the deleterious consequences of hypertension to the cardiovascular system.

        "input": "Our knowledge of how androgens influence the cardiovascular system is far from complete, and this lack of understanding is especially true of how androgens affect resistance vessels. Our aim was to identify the signaling mechanisms stimulated by testosterone (TES) in microvascular arteries and to understand how these mechanisms mediate TES-induced vasodilation. Mesenteric microvessels were isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats. Tension studies demonstrated a rapid, concentration-dependent, vasodilatory response to TES that did not involve protein synthesis or aromatization to 17\u03b2-estradiol. Dichlorofluorescein fluorescence and nitrotyrosine immunoblot experiments indicated that TES stimulated peroxynitrite formation in microvessels, and functional studies demonstrated that TES-induced vasodilation was inhibited by scavenging peroxynitrite. As predicted, TES enhanced the production of both peroxynitrite precursors (i.e., superoxide and nitic oxide), and xanthine oxidase was identified as the likely source of TES-stimulated superoxide production. Functional and biochemical studies indicated that TES signaling involved activity of the phosphoinositide 3 (PI3) kinase-protein kinase B (Akt) cascade initiated by activation of the androgen receptor and culminated in enhanced production of cGMP and microvascular vasodilation. These findings, derived from a variety of analytical and functional approaches, provide evidence for a novel nongenomic signaling mechanism for androgen action in the microvasculature: TES-stimulated vasodilation mediated primarily by peroxynitrite formed from xanthine oxidase-generated superoxide and NO. This response was associated with activation of the PI3 kinase-Akt signaling cascade initiated by activation of the androgen receptor. We propose this mechanism could account for TES-stimulated cGMP production in microvessels and, ultimately, vasodilation.",

Here, we found that butein possesses cytoprotective effects on hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced dental cell death. H2O2 is a representative ROS and causes cell death through necrosis in human dental pulp (HDP) cells. H2O2-induced cytotoxicity and production of ROS were blocked in the presence of butein, and these effects were dose dependent. Butein also increased heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) protein expression and HO activity. In addition, butein-dependent HO-1 expression was required for the inhibition of H2O2-induced cell death and ROS generation. Furthermore, butein treatment caused nuclear accumulation of nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and increased the promoter activity of antioxidant response elements (AREs). Treatment of HDP cells with a c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor also reduced butein-induced HO-1 expression, and butein treatment led to increased JNK phosphorylation.

Although reducing LDL cholesterol (LDL-c) levels decreases morbidity and mortality, this therapeutic intervention only translates into a 25-40% reduction in cardiovascular events. Epidemiological studies have shown that a high LDL-c level is not the only risk factor for CAD; low HDL cholesterol (HDL-c) is an independent risk factor for CAD. Apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) is the major protein component of HDL-c that mediates reverse cholesterol transport from tissues to the liver for excretion. Therefore, increasing ApoA-I levels is an attractive strategy for HDL-c elevation. Using genome-wide siRNA screening, targets that regulate hepatocyte ApoA-I secretion were identified through transfection of 21,789 siRNAs into hepatocytes whereby cell supernatants were assayed for ApoA-I. Approximately 800 genes were identified and triaged using a convergence of information, including genetic associations with HDL-c levels, tissue-specific gene expression, druggability assessments, and pathway analysis. Fifty-nine genes were selected for reconfirmation; 40 genes were confirmed. Here we describe the siRNA screening strategy, assay implementation and validation, data triaging, and example genes of interest. The genes of interest include known and novel genes encoding secreted enzymes, proteases, G-protein-coupled receptors, metabolic enzymes, ion transporters, and proteins of unknown function. Repression of farnesyltransferase (FNTA) by siRNA and the enzyme inhibitor manumycin A caused elevation of ApoA-I secretion from hepatocytes and from transgenic mice expressing hApoA-I and cholesterol ester transfer protein transgenes.

Thus, in the present study, the roles of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3\u03b2) were examined in ursolic acid induced apoptosis in HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Ursolic acid significantly exerted cytotoxicity, increased the sub-G1 population and the number of ethidium homodimer and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase(TdT) mediated dUTP nick end labeling positive cells in HepG2 cells. Also, ursolic acid enhanced the cleavages of poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) and caspase3, attenuated the expression of astrocyte elevated gene (AEG1) and survivin in HepG2 cells. Interestingly, ursolic acid increased the phosphorylation of AMPK and coenzyme A carboxylase and also enhanced phosphorylation of GSK3\u03b2 at inactive form serine 9, whereas ursolic acid attenuated the phosphorylation of AKT and mTOR in HepG2 cells. Conversely, AMPK inhibitor compound C or GSK3\u03b2 inhibitor SB216763 blocked the cleavages of PARP and caspase 3 induced by ursolic acid in HepG2 cells. Furthermore, proteosomal inhibitor MG132 suppressed AMPK activation, GSK3\u03b2 phosphorylation, cleaved PARP and deceased AEG-1 induced by ursolic acid in HepG2 cells.

In the present study, the extent to which six substituted quercetin derivatives (1-6) affected the function of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 was investigated. Uptake of the radiolabeled model substrates estradiol 17\u03b2-glucuronide, estrone 3-sulfate, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) was determined in the absence and presence of compounds 1-6 using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing either OATP1B1 or OATP1B3. Several of compounds 1-6 inhibited OATP-mediated uptake of all three model substrates, suggesting that they could also be potential substrates. Compound 6 stimulated OATP1B3-mediated estradiol 17\u03b2-glucuronide uptake by increasing the apparent affinity of OATP1B3 for its substrate. Cytotoxicity assays demonstrated that epigallocatechin 3-O-gallate (EGCG) and most of compounds 1-6 killed preferentially OATP-expressing CHO cells.

Disruption of the TrxR-Trx1 system keeps Trx1 in the oxidized state leading to cell death through activation of the ASK1-Trx1 apoptotic pathway. The potential mechanism and ability of tri- and tetra-oligopeptides derived from the canonical -CxxC- motif of the Trx1-active site to mimic and enhance Trx1 cellular activity was examined. The Trx mimetics peptides (TXM) protected insulinoma INS 832/13 cells from oxidative stress induced by selectively inhibiting TrxR with auranofin (AuF). TXM reversed the AuF-effects preventing apoptosis, and increasing cell-viability. The TXM peptides were effective in inhibiting AuF-induced MAPK, JNK and p38(MAPK) phosphorylation, in correlation with preventing caspase-3 cleavage and thereby PARP-1 dissociation. The ability to form a disulfide-bridge-like conformation was estimated from molecular dynamics simulations. The TXM peptides restored insulin secretion and displayed Trx1 denitrosylase activity. Their potency was 10-100-fold higher than redox reagents like NAC, AD4, or ascorbic acid. Unable to reverse ERK1/2 phosphorylation, TXM-CB3 (NAc-Cys-Pro-Cys amide) appeared to function in part, through inhibiting ASK1-Trx dissociation. These highly effective anti-apoptotic effects of Trx1 mimetic peptides exhibited in INS 832/13 cells could become valuable in treating adverse oxidative-stress related disorders such as diabetes.",

Since the discovery of the functional role of PXR in 1998, there is evolving evidence for the role of PXR agonists in abrogating metabolic pathophysiology (e.g., cholestasis, hypercholesterolemia, and inflammation). However, more recently, it is clear that PXR is also an important mediator of adverse xeno- (e.g., enhances acetaminophen toxicity) and endobiotic (e.g., hepatic steatosis) metabolic phenotypes. Moreover, in cancer therapeutics, PXR activation can induce drug resistance, and there is growing evidence for tissue-specific enhancement of the malignant phenotype. Thus, in these instances, there may be a role for PXR antagonists. However, as opposed to the discovery efforts for PXR agonists, there are only a few antagonists described. The mode of action of these antagonists (e.g., sulforaphane) remains less clear. Our laboratory efforts have focused on this question. Since the original discovery of azoles analogs as PXR antagonists, we have preliminarily defined an important PXR antagonist pharmacophore and developed less-toxic PXR antagonists. In this review, we describe our published and unpublished findings on recent structure-function studies involving the azole chemical scaffold. Further work in the future is needed to fully define potent, more-selective PXR antagonists that may be useful in clinical application.",

Drebrin, down-regulated by Sim2, was subsequently decreased as detected by confocal laser scanning microscopy and Western blot analysis. The expression pattern of Sim2 and Drebrin correspond to 50mmol/L glucose (hyperglycaemia) was also found in primary cultured neurons. Curcumin, one neuroprotective agent, inhibited hyperglycaemia-induced neurotoxicity. Moreover, curcumin alleviated Sim2 expression, and reversely raised Drebrin expression in neurons treated with hyperglycaemia.

However, the growth inhibitory activity against cancer cells and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Therefore, the anti-proliferative activity of pinosylvin was investigated in human colorectal HCT 116 cancer cells. Pinosylvin inhibited the proliferation of HCT 116 cells by arresting transition of cell cycle from G1 to S phase along with the downregulation of cyclin D1, cyclin E, cyclin A, cyclin dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), CDK4, c-Myc, and retinoblastoma protein (pRb), and the upregulation of p21(WAF1/CIP1) and p53.

Subsequently, pinosylvin suppressed the nuclear translocation of \u03b2-catenin, one of downstream molecules of PI3K/Akt/GSK-3\u03b2 signaling, and these events led to the sequential downregulation of \u03b2-catenin-mediated transcription of target genes including BMP4, ID2, survivin, cyclin D1, MMP7, and c-Myc.

Once the right drug for treatment has been determined, it still takes several weeks for it to take effect and improve mood. This time lag is a serious concern for the healthcare community when dealing with patients with suicidal thoughts. However, recent clinical studies have shown that a single low-dose injection of ketamine, an N-methyl d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, has rapid antidepressant effects that are observed within hours and are long lasting. Although major depression affects twice as many women as men, all studies examining the rapid antidepressant effects of ketamine have focused on male subjects. Thus, we have investigated the behavioral and molecular effects of ketamine in both male and female rats and demonstrated greater sensitivity in female rats at a low dose of ketamine, a dose does not have antidepressant-like effects in male rats. The antidepressant-like effects of this low dose of ketamine were completely abolished when female rats were ovariectomized (OVX), and restored when physiological levels of estrogen and progesterone were supplemented, suggesting a critical role for gonadal hormones in enhancing the antidepressant-like effects of ketamine in female rats. In preclinical studies, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in the medial prefrontal cortex and the eukaryotic elongation factor (eEF2) in the hippocampus have been proposed as critical mediators of ketamine's rapid antidepressant actions. In our hands, the increased sensitivity of female rats to a low dose of ketamine was not mediated through phosphorylation of mTOR or eEF2.",

In this study, we have identified topoisomerase II\u03b2 (Top2\u03b2) as a specific determinant for CPT sensitivity, but not for many other cytotoxic agents, in non-S-phase cells. First, quiescent mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking Top2\u03b2 were shown to be hypersensitive to CPT with prominent induction of apoptosis. Second, ICRF-187, a Top2 catalytic inhibitor known to deplete Top2\u03b2, specifically sensitized MEFs to CPT. To explore the molecular basis for CPT hypersensitivity in Top2\u03b2-deficient cells, we found that upon CPT exposure, the RNA polymerase II large subunit (RNAP LS) became progressively depleted, followed by recovery to nearly the original level in wild-type MEFs, whereas RNAP LS remained depleted without recovery in Top2\u03b2-deficient cells. Concomitant with the reduction of the RNAP LS level, the p53 protein level was greatly induced. Interestingly, RNAP LS depletion has been well documented to lead to p53-dependent apoptosis.

In recent years, fragment-based approaches have emerged as a new methodology in drug discovery; however, few examples of small molecules that are active against chemotherapeutic targets have been published. Herein, we describe the fragment-based approach of targeting the interaction between the tumour suppressor BRCA2 and the recombination enzyme RAD51; it makes use of a screening pipeline of biophysical techniques that we expect to be more generally applicable to similar targets. Disruption of this interaction in vivo is hypothesised to give rise to cellular hypersensitivity to radiation and genotoxic drugs. We have used protein engineering to create a monomeric form of RAD51 by humanising a thermostable archaeal orthologue, RadA, and used this protein for fragment screening. The initial fragment hits were thoroughly validated biophysically by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and NMR techniques and observed by X-ray crystallography to bind in a shallow surface pocket that is occupied in the native complex by the side chain of a phenylalanine from the conserved FxxA interaction motif found in BRCA2.

We have now used mutant forms of M6P/IGF2R to assess the relevance of the different ligand-binding sites of the receptor for its biological activities in this cellular system. The results of the present study demonstrate that M6P/IGF2R does not require a functional binding site for insulin-like growth factor II for inhibition of anchorage-independent growth and matrix invasion by SCC-VII cells. In contrast, the simultaneous mutation of both M6P-binding sites is sufficient to impair all cellular functions of the receptor tested. These findings highlight that the interaction between M6P/IGF2R and M6P-modified ligands is not only important for intracellular accumulation of lysosomal enzymes and formation of dense lysosomes, but is also crucial for the ability of the receptor to suppress SCC-VII growth and invasion. The present study also shows that some of the biological activities of M6P/IGF2R in SCC-VII cells strongly depend on a functional M6P-binding site within domain 3, thus providing further evidence for the non-redundant cellular functions of the individual carbohydrate-binding domains of the receptor.",

Furthermore, mGlu5 has been shown to play an important role in hippocampal synaptic plasticity, specifically in long-term depression (LTD) and long-term potentiation (LTP), which is thought to be involved in cognition. Multiple mGlu5-positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) have been developed from a variety of different scaffolds. Previous work has extensively characterized a common allosteric site on mGlu5, termed the MPEP (2-Methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine) binding site. However, one mGlu5 PAM, CPPHA (N-(4-chloro-2-[(1,3-dioxo-1,3-dihydro-2H-isoindol-2-yl)methyl]phenyl)-2-hydroxybenzamide), interacts with a separate allosteric site on mGlu5. Using cell-based assays and brain slice preparations, we characterized the interaction of a potent and efficacious mGlu5 PAM from the CPPHA series termed NCFP (N-(4-chloro-2-((4-fluoro-1,3-dioxoisoindolin-2-yl)methyl)phenyl)picolinamide). NCFP binds to the CPPHA site on mGlu5 and potentiates mGlu5-mediated responses in both recombinant and native systems. However, NCFP provides greater mGlu5 subtype selectivity than does CPPHA, making it more suitable for studies of effects on mGlu5 in CNS preparations. Of interest, NCFP does not potentiate responses involved in hippocampal synaptic plasticity (LTD/LTP), setting it apart from other previously characterized MPEP site PAMs. This suggests that although mGlu5 PAMs may have similar responses in some systems, they can induce differential effects on mGlu5-mediated physiologic responses in the CNS. Such stimulus bias by mGlu5 PAMs may complicate drug discovery efforts but would also allow for specifically tailored therapies, if pharmacological biases can be attributed to different therapeutic outcomes.",

We assessed obesity-induced changes of n-3-derived SPM in adipose tissue and effects of dietary EPA/DHA thereon.Moreover, we treated obese mice with SPM precursors and investigated effects on inflammation and metabolic dysregulation.

Therefore, this enzyme constitutes a highly attractive therapeutic target for the development of selective inhibitors as new promising drugs for the treatment of these pathologies. We describe here the isolation and biochemical characterization of the marine natural sesquiterpene palinurin as a GSK-3\u03b2 inhibitor. Experimental studies performed for characterizing the inhibitory mechanism indicate that GSK-3\u03b2 inhibition by palinurin cannot be competed out by ATP nor peptide substrate. Molecular modelling techniques have enabled us to propose an unconventional binding mode to GSK-3\u03b2. Moreover, molecular dynamics simulations have identified an allosteric mechanism by which binding of palinurin leads to GSK-3\u03b2 inhibition. The inhibitory activities determined for a series of structurally related analogues support the proposed binding mode of palinurin, which is the first compound described to target this allosteric site. The results offer new opportunities for designing and developing selective inhibitors with novel mechanisms of action.",

Transcriptomic profiles revealed 21, 62, and 64 genes with altered expression in the 0.3, 3, and 30 ppb atrazine treatments, respectively. Altered genes were associated with neuroendocrine and reproductive system development, function, and disease; cell cycle control; and carcinogenesis. There was a significant overlap (42 genes) between the 3 and 30 ppb differentially expressed gene lists, with two of these genes (CYP17A1 and SAMHD1) present in all three atrazine treatments.

The tissue-selective toxicity of DCBN in mouse nasal mucosa is largely dependent on target tissue bioactivation by CYP2A5. The human orthologues of CYP2A5, CYP2A6 and CYP2A13, are both expressed in nasal mucosa and are capable of activating DCBN. In this study, we directly determined the ability of human nasal mucosa to bioactivate DCBN. We also tested the suitability of a glutathione conjugate of DCBN (GS-DCBN) or its derivatives as biomarkers of DCBN exposure and nasal toxicity in mouse models. We found that human fetal nasal mucosa microsomes catalyze the formation of GS-DCBN, with a Km value comparable to that of adult mouse nasal mucosa microsomes. The activity of the human nasal mucosa microsomes was inhibited by 8-methoxypsoralen, a known CYP2A inhibitor. GS-DCBN and its metabolites were detected in the nasal mucosa and nasal-wash fluid obtained from DCBN-treated mice, in amounts that increased with escalations in DCBN dose, and they were all still detectable at 24 h after a DCBN treatment (at 10 mg/kg). Further studies in Cyp2a5-null mice indicated that GS-DCBN and its metabolites in nasal-wash fluid were generated in the nasal mucosa, rather than in other organs. Thus, our data indicate for the first time that the human nasal mucosa is capable of bioactivating DCBN and that GS-DCBN and its metabolites in nasal-wash fluid may collectively serve as indicators of DCBN exposure and potential nasal toxicity in humans.",

        "input": "In many renal diseases, transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2)-stimulated canonical Smad 3 and noncanonical mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) promote increased protein synthesis and mesangial cell hypertrophy. The cellular underpinnings involving these signaling molecules to regulate mesangial cell hypertrophy are not fully understood. Deptor has recently been identified as an mTOR interacting protein and functions as an endogenous inhibitor of the kinase activity for both TORC1 and TORC2. Prolonged incubation of mesangial cells with TGF\u03b2 reduced the levels of deptor concomitant with an increase in TORC1 and TORC2 activity. Sustained TGF\u03b2 activation was required to inhibit association of deptor with mTOR, whereas rapid activation had no effect. Using the mTOR inhibitor PP242, we found that TGF\u03b2-induced both early and sustained activation of TORC1 and TORC2 was necessary for deptor suppression. PP242-induced reversal of deptor suppression by TGF\u03b2 was associated with a significant inhibition of TGF\u03b2-stimulated protein synthesis and hypertrophy. Interestingly, expression of siRNA against Smad 3 or Smad 7, which blocks TGF\u03b2 receptor-specific Smad 3 signaling, prevented TGF\u03b2-induced suppression of deptor abundance and TORC1/2 activities. Furthermore, overexpression of Smad 3 decreased deptor expression similar to TGF\u03b2 stimulation concomitant with increased TORC1 and TORC2 activities. Finally, knockdown of deptor reversed Smad 7-mediated inhibition of protein synthesis and mesangial cell hypertrophy induced by TGF\u03b2. These data reveal the requirement of both early and late activation of mTOR for TGF\u03b2-induced protein synthesis. Our results support that TGF\u03b2-stimulated Smad 3 acts as a key node to instill a feedback loop between deptor down-regulation and TORC1/2 activation in driving mesangial cell hypertrophy.",

Phthalide is structurally related to isatin and phthalimide and it is demonstrated here that substitution at C6 of the phthalide moiety yields compounds endowed with high binding affinities to both human MAO isoforms.

In the present study, we isolated catalpol from R. glutinosa, and examined whether it has anti-inflammatory effects on AGE-stimulated THP-1 cells. Catalpol reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory mediates, such as monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), inducible NO synthase (iNOS), and receptor for AGE (RAGE). Promoter and electromobility shift assays showed that transcriptional activation of NF-\u03baB was significantly reduced by catalpol treatment, while AP-1 was not. Catalpol also suppressed AGE-induced phosphorylation of mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinases, degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 and the nuclear localization of NF-\u03baB. Moreover, the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) elicited by AGE was also suppressed by catalpol treatment, through dual action of reducing ROS itself and inhibiting NADPH oxidase activity.

Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the endothelium of rabbit aortic valve leaflets and endothelium-denuded RIA and aortic rings was assessed by imaging of dihydroethidium. In the iliac artery, exposure to 100\u03bcM arsenite for 30min potentiated EDHF-type relaxations evoked by both CPA and ACh. Potentiation was prevented by catalase, the catalase/superoxide dismutase mimetic manganese porphyrin and the NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin. By contrast in aortic rings, that exhibited negligible EDHF-type responses, endothelium-dependent NO-mediated relaxations evoked by CPA and ACh were unaffected by arsenite. Arsenite induced apocynin-sensitive increases in ROS production in the aortic valve endothelium, but not in the media and adventitia of the iliac artery and aorta. Our results suggest that arsenite can potentiate EDHF-type relaxations via a mechanism that is dependent on hydrogen peroxide, thus demonstrating that dismutation of the superoxide anion generated by NADPH oxidase can potentially offset loss of NO bioavailability under conditions of reduced eNOS activity.

        "input": "Carboxylesterases hydrolyze esters, amides, and thioesters to produce carboxylic acids and resulting alcohols, amines, and thiols, respectively. Uridine 5'-diphosphate- glucuronosyltransferases are colocalized with carboxylesterases and have the potential to further metabolize carboxylic acids to acyl glucuronides, but it is currently unknown if acyl glucuronides, being esters, also interact with carboxylesterases. Objective: This study explores the ability of acyl glucuronides to act as substrates or inhibitors of human carboxylesterases 1 (hCES1) and 2 (hCES2). Methods: The stability of six acyl glucuronides in the presence of hCES1, hCES2, and buffer alone (100 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 37\u00b0C) were investigated. Reversible inhibition of 4-nitrophenyl acetate hydrolysis by the acyl glucuronides was also studied. Diclofenac-\u03b2-d-glucuronide was used to explore potential time-dependent inactivation. Results: The chemical stability half-life values for CGP 47292-\u03b2-d-glucuronide, diclofenac-\u03b2-d-glucuronide, (R)-naproxen-\u03b2-d-glucuronide, (S)-naproxen-\u03b2-d-glucuronide, ibuprofen-\u03b2-d-glucuronide (racemic), clopidogrel-\u03b2-d-glucuronide, and valproate-\u03b2-d-glucuronide were found to be 0.252, 0.537, 0.996, 1.77, 3.67, 5.02, and 15.2 hours, respectively.

Valproate-\u03b2-d-glucuronide and CGP 47292-\u03b2-d-glucuronide did not inhibit either hCES. Time-dependent inactivation of hCES1 by diclofenac-\u03b2-d-glucuronide was not observed. Lastly, both hCES1 and hCES2 were shown not to catalyze the hydrolysis of the acyl glucuronides studied. Conclusion: Drug-drug interaction studies may be warranted for drugs that metabolize to acyl glucuronides due to the potential inhibition of hCESs.",

In this study, an in vitro model of human embryonic stem cell (hESC) differentiation into mammary epithelial cells was applied to investigate the effect of low dose BPA on the early stages of mammogenesis. A newly established hESC line was directionally differentiated into mammary epithelial cells by a well-established three-dimensional (3D) culture system. The differentiated mammary epithelial cells were characterized by immunofluorescence and western blotting assay, and were called induced differentiated mammary epithelial cells (iDMECs) based on these data. The hESCs were treated with low doses of BPA range 10(-9)-10(-6)M during the differentiation process, with DMSO as the solvent control and 17-\u03b2-estrodiol (E2) as the estrogen-positive control. Our results showed that low dose BPA and E2 could influence the mammosphere area of iDMECs and upregulate the expression level of Oct4 and Nanog proteins, while only BPA could downregulate the expression of E-cadherin protein. Taken together, this study provides some insights into the effects of low dose BPA on the early differentiation stage of mammary epithelial cells and suggests an easier canceration status of iDMECs under the effect of low dose BPA during its early differentiation stage.",

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In a historical prospective cohort study of subjects from the Clalit Health Services database, which includes information on nearly 4 million people, diabetes-free subjects aged 40-70 years with serum 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25-OHD) measurements available were followed for 2 years to assess the development of IFG and diabetes in five 25-OHD subgroups: \u226525, 25.1-37.5, 37.6-50, 50.1-75, and >75 nmol/L. RESULTS The baseline cohort included 117,960 adults: 83,526 normoglycemic subjects and 34,434 subjects with IFG. During follow-up, 8,629 subjects (10.3% of the normoglycemic group) developed IFG, and 2,162 subjects (1.8% of the total cohort) progressed to diabetes. A multivariable model adjusted for age, sex, population group, immigrant status, BMI, season of vitamin D measurement, LDL and HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, estimated glomerular filtration rate, history of hypertension or cardiovascular disease, Charlson comorbidity index, smoking, and socioeconomic status revealed an inverse association between 25-OHD and the risk of progression to IFG and diabetes. The odds of transitioning from normoglycemia to IFG, from normoglycemia to diabetes, and from IFG to diabetes in subjects with a 25-OHD level \u226425 nmol/L were greater than those of subjects with a 25-OHD level >75 nmol/L [odds ratio 1.13 (95% CI 1.03-1.24), 1.77 (1.11-2.83), and 1.43 (1.16-1.76), respectively].

        "input": "5-Methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT or street name \"5-MEO\") is a newer designer drug belonging to a group of naturally occurring indolealkylamines. Our recent study has demonstrated that coadministration of monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) inhibitor harmaline (5 mg/kg) increases systemic exposure to 5-MeO-DMT (2 mg/kg) and active metabolite bufotenine. This study is aimed at delineating harmaline and 5-MeO-DMT pharmacokinetic (PK) interactions at multiple dose levels, as well as the impact of CYP2D6 that affects harmaline PK and determines 5-MeO-DMT O-demethylation to produce bufotenine. Our data revealed that inhibition of MAO-A-mediated metabolic elimination by harmaline (2, 5, and 15 mg/kg) led to a sharp increase in systemic and cerebral exposure to 5-MeO-DMT (2 and 10 mg/kg) at all dose combinations. A more pronounced effect on 5-MeO-DMT PK was associated with greater exposure to harmaline in wild-type mice than CYP2D6-humanized (Tg-CYP2D6) mice. Harmaline (5 mg/kg) also increased blood and brain bufotenine concentrations that were generally higher in Tg-CYP2D6 mice. Surprisingly, greater harmaline dose (15 mg/kg) reduced bufotenine levels. The in vivo inhibitory effect of harmaline on CYP2D6-catalyzed bufotenine formation was confirmed by in vitro study using purified CYP2D6. Given these findings, a unified PK model including the inhibition of MAO-A- and CYP2D6-catalyzed 5-MeO-DMT metabolism by harmaline was developed to describe blood harmaline, 5-MeO-DMT, and bufotenine PK profiles in both wild-type and Tg-CYP2D6 mouse models. This PK model may be further employed to predict harmaline and 5-MeO-DMT PK interactions at various doses, define the impact of CYP2D6 status, and drive harmaline-5-MeO-DMT pharmacodynamics.",

        "input": "Increased sympathetic nervous system activity contributes to deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertension in rats. ATP and norepinephrine (NE) are coreleased from perivascular sympathetic nerves. NE acts at prejunctional \u03b12-adrenergic receptors (\u03b12ARs) to inhibit NE release, and \u03b12AR function is impaired in DOCA-salt rats. Adenosine, an enzymatic ATP degradation product, acts at prejunctional A1 adenosine receptors (A1Rs) to inhibit NE release. We tested the hypothesis that prejunctional A1R function is impaired in sympathetic nerves supplying mesenteric arteries (MAs) and veins (MVs) of DOCA-salt rats. Electrically evoked NE release and constrictions of blood vessels were studied in vitro with use of amperometry to measure NE oxidation currents and video microscopy, respectively. Immunohistochemical methods were used to localize tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and A1Rs in perivascular sympathetic nerves. TH and A1Rs colocalized to perivascular sympathetic nerves. Adenosine and N(6)-cyclopentyl-adenosine (CPA, A1R agonist) constricted MVs but not MAs. Adenosine and CPA (0.001-10 \u00b5M) inhibited neurogenic constrictions and NE release in MAs and MVs. DOCA-salt arteries were resistant to adenosine and CPA-mediated inhibition of NE release and constriction. The A2A adenosine receptor agonist CGS21680 (C23H29N7O6.HCl.xH2O) (0.001-0.1 \u03bcM) did not alter NE oxidation currents. We conclude that there are prejunctional A1Rs in arteries and both pre- and postjunctional A1Rs in veins; thus, adenosine selectively constricts the veins. Prejunctional A1R function is impaired in arteries, but not veins, from DOCA-salt rats. Sympathetic autoreceptor dysfunction is not specific to \u03b12ARs, but there is a more general disruption of prejunctional mechanisms controlling sympathetic neurotransmitter release in DOCA-salt hypertension.",

Here, we examined the hypothesis that (\u00b7)NO generation contributes to cancer cell drug resistance toward the widely used anticancer drug Etoposide (VP-16). The UV-vis spectrum of VP-16 was not changed by exposure of VP-16 to (\u00b7)NO in aqueous buffer. In contrast, reddish-orange compound(s) characteristic of o-quinone- and nitroso-VP-16 were readily generated in a hydrophobic medium (chloroform) in an oxygen-dependent manner. Similar products were also formed when the VP-16 radical, generated from VP-16 and horseradish peroxidase/H2O2, was exposed directly to (\u00b7)NO in chloroform in the presence of oxygen. Separation and spectral analysis of VP-16 reaction extracts by electron spin resonance and UV-vis indicated the generation of the phenoxy radical and the o-quinone of VP-16, as well as putative nitroxide, iminoxyl, and other nitrogen oxide intermediates. Nitric oxide products of VP-16 displayed significantly diminished topoisomerase II-dependent cleavage of DNA and cytotoxicity to human HL-60 leukemia cells. LPS-mediated induction of nitric oxide synthase in murine macrophages resulted in VP-16 resistance compared to Raw cells. Furthermore, (\u00b7)NO products derived from iNOS rapidly reacted with VP-16 leading to decreased DNA damage and cytotoxicity. Together, these observations suggest that the formation of (\u00b7)NO in tumors (associated macrophages) can contribute to VP-16 resistance via the detoxification of VP-16.",

Levels of Cx43 protein were also decreased in a dose- and time-dependent manner following antofine treatment. Double-labeling immunofluorescence microscopy showed that antofine (10ng/ml) induced endocytosis of surface gap junctions into the cytoplasm, where Cx43 was co-localized with the early endosome marker EEA1. Inhibition of lysosomes or proteasomes by co-treatment with antofine and their respective specific inhibitors, NH4Cl or MG132, partially inhibited the antofine-induced decrease in Cx43 protein levels, but did not inhibit the antofine-induced inhibition of GJIC. After 30min of treatment, antofine induced a rapid increase in the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration and activation of protein kinase C (PKC)\u03b1/\u03b2II, which was maintained for at least 6h. Co-treatment of astrocytes with antofine and the intracellular Ca(2+) chelator BAPTA-AM prevented downregulation of Cx43 and inhibition of GJIC. Moreover, co-treatment with antofine and a specific PKC\u03b2 inhibitor prevented endocytosis of gap junctions, downregulation of Cx43, and inhibition of GJIC.

The centerpiece of the AND gate is a bisected methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRS) that charges the Met surrogate azidonorleucine (Anl) to tRNA(Met). Cellular protein labeling occurs only upon activation of two different promoters that drive expression of the N- and C-terminal fragments of the bisected MetRS. Anl-labeled proteins can be tagged with fluorescent dyes or affinity reagents via either copper-catalyzed or strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition. Protein labeling is apparent within 5 min after addition of Anl to bacterial cells in which the AND gate has been activated. This method allows spatial and temporal control of proteomic labeling and identification of proteins made in specific cellular subpopulations. The approach is demonstrated by selective labeling of proteins in bacterial cells immobilized in the center of a laminar-flow microfluidic channel, where they are exposed to overlapping, opposed gradients of inducers of the N- and C-terminal MetRS fragments.

Despite this success there are many important aspects of GPCR pharmacology and function that have yet to be exploited to their full therapeutic potential. One in particular that has been gaining attention in recent times is that of GPCR ligands that bind to allosteric sites on the receptor distinct from the orthosteric site of the endogenous ligand. As therapeutics, allosteric ligands possess many theoretical advantages over their orthosteric counterparts, including more complex modes of action, improved safety, more physiologically appropriate responses, better target selectivity, and reduced likelihood of desensitisation and tachyphylaxis. Despite these advantages, the development of allosteric ligands is often difficult from a medicinal chemistry standpoint due to the more complex challenge of identifying allosteric leads and their often flat or confusing SAR.

The docking results suggested that the benzene ring of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinazolin ring system of these molecules occupied the deep hydrophobic pocket of the protein and one of the NH along with the sulfonyl group participated in strong H-bonding interaction with the amino acid residues.",

The expression levels of HLA-DR (MHC class II) and CD86 (costimulatory molecule) were measured as an indicator of antigen presentation in TDDCs. A significant decrease in HLA-DR expression was observed in the AP and fractionated procyanidin-treated cells in the presence of ovalbumin (OVA), but no effect on CD86 expression was observed. The uptake of OVA was not inhibited by AP treatment, and the gene expression of membrane-associated RING-CH ubiquitin E3 ligase, MARCH1, was up-regulated by AP treatment. It can therefore be presumed that AP suppresses HLA-DR expression via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Furthermore, the up-regulation of IL-12 and TNF-\u03b1 was found in the procyanidin trimers-treated cells in the presence of OVA. These results suggest that apple polyphenols would be an effective factor for the development of immunomodulatory agents with suppressive effects of antigen presentation.",

The results show that LSOPC has a significant anti-glycative activity in vitro and it can also effectively protect the secondary structure of BSA during glycation. LSOPC or catechin (a major constituent unit of LSOPC), were used to react with methylglyoxal. The structures of their carbonyl adducts were tentatively identified using HPLC-MS(2).

Although glutathione S-transferase omega 1 (GSTO1) and arsenic methyltransferase have been shown or thought to catalyze DMAs(V) reduction, their role in DMAs(V) reduction in vivo, or in cell extracts is uncertain. Therefore, the reduction of DMAs(V) to DMAs(III) in rats and in rat liver cytosol was studied to better understand its mechanism. To assess DMAs(V) reduction in rats, a novel procedure was devised based on following the accumulation of red blood cell (RBC)-bound dimethylarsenic (DMAs), which represents DMAs(III), in the blood of DMAs(V)-injected anesthetized rats. These studies indicated that rats reduced DMAs(V) to DMAs(III) to a significant extent, as in 90 min 31% of the injected 50 \u03bcmol/kg DMAs(V) dose was converted to DMAs(III) that was sequestered by the circulating erythrocytes. Pretreatment of rats with glutathione (GSH) depletors (phorone or BSO) delayed the elimination of DMAs(V) and the accumulation of RBC-bound DMAs, whereas the indirect methyltransferase inhibitor periodate-oxidized adenosine was without effect. Assessment of DMAs(V)-reducing activity of rat liver cytosol revealed that reduction of DMAs(V) required cytosolic protein and GSH and was inhibited by thiol reagents, GSSG and dehydroascorbate. Although thioredoxin reductase (TRR) inhibitors (aurothioglucose and Sb(III)) inhibited cytosolic DMAs(V) reduction, recombinant rat TRR plus NADPH, alone or when added to the cytosol, failed to support DMAs(V) reduction. On ultrafiltration of the cytosol through a 3 kDa filter, the reducing activity in the retentate was lost but was largely restored by NADPH. Such experiments also suggested that the reducing enzyme was larger than 100 kDa and was not GSTO1. In summary, reduction of DMAs(V) to the highly toxic DMAs(III) in rats and rat liver cytosol is a GSH-dependent enzymatic process, yet its mechanism remains uncertain.",

However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. One prominent model is that cold temperatures reduce the rate of chemical reactions, thereby slowing the rate of aging. This view suggests that cold-dependent lifespan extension is simply a passive thermodynamic process. Here, we challenge this view in C. elegans by showing that genetic programs actively promote longevity at cold temperatures. We find that TRPA-1, a cold-sensitive TRP channel, detects temperature drop in the environment to extend lifespan. This effect requires cold-induced, TRPA-1-mediated calcium influx and a calcium-sensitive PKC that signals to the transcription factor DAF-16/FOXO. Human TRPA1 can functionally substitute for worm TRPA-1 in promoting longevity. Our results reveal a previously unrecognized function for TRP channels, link calcium signaling to longevity, and, importantly, demonstrate that genetic programs contribute to lifespan extension at cold temperatures.",

Excessive accumulations in liver TG and TC in ethanol control group were also suppressed by co-administration of CNF. Co-administration of CNF maintained SOD activity, GSH and malondialdehyde levels close to those of the normal diet group. Chronic consumption of alcohol also stimulated abrupt increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines such as nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 in liver otherwise co-administration of CNF effectively suppressed production of these cytokines dose-dependently.

BPA 5.0 males and females had increased body weight, body mass index, body surface area, and adiposity. Echocardiography identified concentric remodeling in all BPA-treated males. Systolic and diastolic cardiac functions were essentially similar, but lifelong BPA enhanced male and reduced female sex-specific differences in velocity of circumferential shortening and ascending aorta velocity time integral.

The calcium homeostasis proteins sarcoendoplasmic reticulum ATPase 2a (SERCA2a), sodium calcium exchanger-1, phospholamban (PLB), phospho-PLB, and calsequestrin 2 are important for contraction and relaxation. Changes in their expression suggest increased calcium mobility in males and reduced calcium mobility in females supporting the cardiac function changes. DNA methyltransferase 3a expression was increased in all BPA males and BPA 0.5 females and reduced in BPA 200 females. Global DNA methylation was increased in BPA 0.5 males and reduced in BPA 0.5 females. BPA induced sex-specific altered DNA methylation in specific CpG pairs in the calsequestrin 2 CpG island.

AhR-dependent reporter gene expression in transfected HepG2 cells was increased by pelargonidin in a concentration-dependent manner at 24h. Similarly, pelargonidin induced the expression of CYP1A1 mRNA up to 5-fold in HepG2 and LS174T cells relative to the induction by 5 nM 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (TCDD), the most potent activator of AhR. CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 mRNAs were also increased by pelargonidin in three primary human hepatocytes cultures (approximately 5% of TCDD potency) and the increase in CYP1A1 protein in HepG2 and LS174T cells was comparable to the increase in catalytic activity of CYP1A1 enzyme. Ligand binding analysis demonstrated that pelargonidin was a weak ligand of AhR. Enzyme kinetic analyses using human liver microsomes revealed inhibition of CYP1A1 activity by delphinidin (IC50 78 \u03bcM) and pelargonidin (IC50 33 \u03bcM).

        "input": "INTRODUCTION: Accumulating evidence suggests that patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hyperinsulinemia are at increased risk for developing malignancies. It remains to be fully elucidated whether use of metformin, an insulin sensitizer, and/or sulfonylureas, insulin secretagogues, affect cancer incidence in subjects with T2DM. MATERIAL & METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis using PubMed, of randomized control trials (RCTs), cohorts, and case-control studies published through July 2012 that assess effects of metformin and/or sulfonylurea sulfonylureas on cancer risk at any site, in subjects with T2DM. Fixed and random effects meta-analysis models were used, and the effect size was summarized as relative risk (RR) for RCTs/cohorts and as odds ratio (OR) for the case-control studies. RESULTS: Analysis of 24 metformin studies in subjects with T2DM showed that metformin use is associated with reduced risk for the development of cancer, in both cohort (RR=0.70 [95% CI=0.67-0.73]) and case-control studies (OR=0.90 [95% CI=0.84-0.98]), but this finding was not supported by RCTs (RR=1.01[95% CI=0.81-1.26]). Data from 18 sulfonylurea studies in subjects with T2DM showed that sulfonylurea use is associated with an increase in all-cancer risk, in cohort studies (RR=1.55 [95% CI=1.48 -1.63]), though data from RCTs (RR=1.17 [95% CI=0.95-1.45]) and case-control studies (OR=1.02 [95% CI=0.93-1.13]) failed to demonstrate a statistically significant effect. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis using pooled primary data demonstrates that metformin use reduces, while sulfonylurea use may be associated with an increased cancer risk in subjects with T2DM. These findings need to be confirmed in large-scale RCTs before they are translated into clinical practice.",

        "input": "Vascular aging is characterized by up-regulation of NADPH oxidase, oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction. Previous studies demonstrate that the activity of the evolutionarily conserved NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase SIRT1 declines with age and that pharmacological activators of SIRT1 confer significant anti-aging cardiovascular effects. To determine whether dysregulation of SIRT1 promotes NADPH oxidase-dependent production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and impairs endothelial function we assessed the effects of three structurally different inhibitors of SIRT1 (nicotinamide, sirtinol, EX527) in aorta segments isolated from young Wistar rats. Inhibition of SIRT1 induced endothelial dysfunction, as shown by the significantly reduced relaxation to the endothelium-dependent vasodilators acetylcholine and the calcium ionophore A23187. Endothelial dysfunction induced by SIRT1 inhibition was prevented by treatment of the vessels with the NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin or superoxide dismutase. Inhibition of SIRT1 significantly increased vascular superoxide production, enhanced NADPH oxidase activity, and mRNA expression of its subunits p22(phox) and NOX4, which were prevented by resveratrol. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b1 (PPAR\u03b1) activation mimicked the effects of resveratrol while PPAR\u03b1 inhibition prevented the effects of this SIRT1 activator. SIRT1 co-precipitated with PPAR\u03b1 and nicotinamide increased the acetylation of the PPAR\u03b1 coactivator PGC-1\u03b1, which was suppressed by resveratrol. In conclusion, impaired activity of SIRT1 induces endothelial dysfunction and up-regulates NADPH oxidase-derived ROS production in the vascular wall, mimicking the vascular aging phenotype. Moreover, a new mechanism for controlling endothelial function after SIRT1 activation involves a decreased PGC-1\u03b1 acetylation and the subsequent PPAR\u03b1 activation, resulting in both decreased NADPH oxidase-driven ROS production and NO inactivation.",

Using cultured human keratinocytes and diabetic rat model, the current study showed that high-glucose environment enhanced IL-8 production via epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) -extracelluar signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway in a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent manner in keratinocytes. In addition, diabetic rat skin showed enhanced EGFR, ERK and IL-8 expression as compared to control rats. The dermal neutrophil infiltration of the wound, as represented by expression of myeloperoxidase level, was also significantly higher in diabetic rats. Treating diabetic rats with dapsone, an agent known to inhibit neutrophil function, was associated with improved healing.

For this purpose, C57BL6 mice were injected intraperitoneally with V(5+) (5\u00a0mg/kg) in the absence and presence of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) (15\u00a0\u03bcg/kg) for 6 and 24\u00a0h. Furthermore, isolated hepatocytes from C57BL6 mice were treated with V(5+) (5, 10, and 20\u00a0\u03bcM) in the absence and presence of TCDD (1 nM) for 3, 6, 12, and 24\u00a0h. In vivo, V(5+) alone did not significantly alter Cyp1a1, Cyp1a2, or Cyp1b1 mRNA, protein, or catalytic activity levels. Upon co-exposure to V(5+) and TCDD, V(5+) significantly potentiated the TCDD-mediated induction of the Cyp1a1, Cyp1a2, and Cyp1b1 mRNA, protein, and catalytic activity levels at 24\u00a0h. In vitro, V(5+) decreased the TCDD-mediated induction of Cyp1a1 mRNA, protein, and catalytic activity levels. Furthermore, V(5+) significantly inhibited the TCDD-induced AhR-dependent luciferase activity. V(5+) also increased serum hemoglobin (Hb) levels in animals treated for 24\u00a0h. Upon treatment of isolated hepatocytes with Hb alone or in the presence of TCDD, there was an increase in the AhR-dependent luciferase activity. When isolated hepatocytes were treated for 2\u00a0h with V(5+) in the presence of TCDD, followed by replacement of the medium with new medium containing Hb, there was further potentiation to the TCDD-mediated effect. The present study demonstrates that there is a differential modulation of Cyp1a1 by V(5+) in C57BL/6 mice livers and isolated hepatocytes and demonstrates Hb as an in vivo specific modulator.",

        "input": "In mice, in utero exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p- dioxin (TCDD) reduces the number of dorsolateral prostatic buds resulting in a smaller dorsolateral prostate and prevents formation of ventral buds culminating in ventral prostate agenesis. The genes and signaling pathways affected by TCDD that are responsible for disrupting prostate development are largely unknown. Here we show that treatment of urogenital sinus (UGS) organ cultures with known inhibitors of canonical Wnt signaling also inhibits prostatic bud formation. In support of the hypothesis that TCDD decreases canonical Wnt signaling, we identify inhibitory effects of TCDD on multiple components of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway in the UGS that temporally coincide with the inhibitory effect of TCDD on prostatic bud formation: (1) expression of R-spondins (Rspo2 and Rspo3) that promote canonical Wnt signaling is reduced; (2) expression of Lef1, Tcf1, and Wif1, established canonical Wnt target genes, is decreased; (3) expression of Lgr5, a RSPO receptor that activates canonical Wnt signaling, is reduced; and (4) expression of Dickkopfs (Dkks), inhibitors of canonical Wnt signaling, is not increased by TCDD. Thus, the TCDD-induced reduction in canonical Wnt signaling is associated with a decrease in activators (Rspo2 and Rspo3) rather than an increase in inhibitors (Dkk1 and Dkk2) of the pathway. This study focuses on determining whether treatment of TCDD-exposed UGS organ cultures with RSPO2 and/or RSPO3 is capable of rescuing the inhibitory effects of TCDD on canonical Wnt signaling and prostatic bud formation. We discovered that each RSPO alone or in combination partially rescues TCDD inhibition of both canonical Wnt signaling and prostatic bud formation.",

We found that risk allele (T) frequency of rs7903146 was significantly higher in T2DM-PDR patients (allelic P = 2.52E-04). In lymphoblastoid cells induced to undergo endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress by treatment of tunicamycin, higher fold change of TCF7L2 and VEGFA mRNA levels were observed in rs7903146-TT cells than that in rs7903146-CC cells (P = 0.02 for TCF7L2; P = 0.004 for VEGFA), suggesting ER stress plays a role in PDR pathogenesis. Silencing TCF7L2 resulted in decreased mRNA levels of both TCF7L2 and VEGFA (P < 0.001). Retinas of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) mice (a model for PDR) had higher TCF7L2 and VEGFA mRNA levels than controls (P = 2.9E-04 for TCF7L2; P = 1.9E-07 for VEGFA).

In this study, we investigated the hepatoprotective and antifibrotic effects of sinapic acid on dimethylnitrosamine (DMN)-induced chronic liver injury in rats. Sinapic acid remarkably prevented DMN-induced loss of body weight. This was accompanied by a significant increase in levels of serum alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, and liver malondialdehyde content. Furthermore, sinapic acid reduced hepatic hydroxyproline content, which correlated with a reduction in the expression of type I collagen mRNA and histological analysis of collagen in liver tissue. Additionally, the expression of hepatic fibrosis-related factors such as \u03b1-smooth muscle actin and transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), were reduced in rats treated with sinapic acid. Sinapic acid exhibited strong scavenging activity. In conclusion, we find that sinapic acid exhibits hepatoprotective and antifibrotic effects against DMN-induced liver injury, most likely due to its antioxidant activities of scavenging radicals, its capacity to suppress TGF-\u03b21 and its ability to attenuate activation of hepatic stellate cells.

Ex vivo [isolated jejunal segment (IJS) of rat], in vitro, and in vivo assays were used in the study. The results indicated that genistin (5-80 \u03bcmol/L) inhibited the contraction of IJS in a dose-dependent manner and inhibited the increased-contractility of IJS induced by acetylcholine (ACh), histamine, high Ca(2+), and erythromycin, respectively. The inhibitory effects of genistin were correlated with the stimulation of alpha adrenergic and beta adrenergic receptors since these inhibitory effects were significantly blocked in the presence of phentolamine and propranolol respectively. No further inhibitory effects of genistin were observed in the presence of verapamil or in Ca(2+)-free condition, indicating genistin-induced inhibitory effects are Ca(2+)-dependent. Genistin decreased myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) protein contents and MLCK mRNA expression in IJS, and inhibited both phosphorylation and Mg(2+)-ATPase activity of purified myosin, implicating that the decrease of MLCK contents and inhibition of MLCK activity are involved in the genistin-induced inhibitory effects.

        "input": "The mechanisms of progression from Barrett's esophagus (BE) to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) are not known. Cycloxygenase-2 (COX-2)-derived prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) has been shown to be important in esophageal tumorigenesis. We have shown that COX-2 mediates acid-induced PGE2 production. The prostaglandin E synthase (PGES) responsible for acid-induced PGE2 production in BE, however, is not known. We found that microsomal PGES1 (mPGES1), mPGES2, and cytosolic PGES (cPGES) were present in FLO EA cells. Pulsed acid treatment significantly increased mPGES1 mRNA and protein levels but had little or no effect on mPGES2 or cPGES mRNA. Knockdown of mPGES1 by mPGES1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) blocked acid-induced increase in PGE2 production and thymidine incorporation. Knockdown of NADPH oxidase, NOX5-S, a variant lacking calcium-binding domains, by NOX5 siRNA significantly inhibited acid-induced increase in mPGES1 expression, thymidine incorporation, and PGE2 production. Overexpression of NOX5-S significantly increased the luciferase activity in FLO cells transfected with a nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) in vivo activation reporter plasmid pNF-\u03baB-Luc. Knockdown of NF-\u03baB1 p50 by p50 siRNA significantly decreased acid-induced increase in mPGES1 expression, thymidine incorporation, and PGE2 production. Two novel NF-\u03baB binding elements, GGAGTCTCCC and CGGGACACCC, were identified in the mPGES1 gene promoter. We conclude that mPGES1 mediates acid-induced increase in PGE2 production and cell proliferation. Acid-induced mPGES1 expression depends on activation of NOX5-S and NF-\u03baB1 p50.

In this study, six healthy adult male subjects received a single i.v. dose of [(14)C]GSK2251052, 1500 mg infused over 1 hour. Blood, urine, and feces were collected over an extended period of 14 days, and accelerator mass spectrometry was used to quantify low levels of radioactivity in plasma at later time points to supplement the less-sensitive liquid scintillation counting technique. An excellent mass balance recovery was achieved representing a mean total of 98.2% of the dose, including 90.5% recovered in the urine. Pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated that radioactivity was moderately associated with the blood cellular components, and together with GSK2251052, both were highly distributed into tissues. The parent compound had a much shorter half-life than total radioactivity in plasma, approximately 11.6 hours compared with 96 hours.

Additionally, M3 was eliminated renally, and was demonstrated to be responsible for the long plasma radioactivity elimination half-life.

Regucalcin has been shown to play a multifunctional role in cell regulation; maintaining of intracellular calcium homeostasis and suppressing of signal transduction, translational protein synthesis, nuclear deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) synthesis, proliferation, and apoptosis in many cell types. Moreover, regucalcin may play a pathophysiological role in metabolic disorder.

Overexpression of endogenous regucalcin stimulates glucose utilization and lipid production in liver cells with glucose supplementation in vitro. Regucalcin reveals insulin resistance in liver cells. Deficiency of regucalcin induces an impairment of glucose tolerance and lipid accumulation in the liver of mice in vivo. Overexpression of endogenous regucalcin has been shown to decrease triglyceride, total cholesterol and glycogen contents in the liver of rats, inducing hyperlipidemia.

Both cyclin B1 and p-cdc2 levels increased, while cyclin B1 remained in the cytoplasm; suggesting arrest in the G2/M transition point. Remarkably, after exposure to AOH for 24h, most of the cells exhibited abnormally shaped nuclei, as evidenced by partly divided nuclei, nuclear blebs, polyploidy and micronuclei (MN). AOH treatment also induced abnormal Aurora B bridges, suggesting that cytokinesis was interfered within cells undergoing karyokinesis. A minor part of the resultant G1 tetraploid (4N) cells re-entered the S-phase and progressed to 8N cells.",

NMDA receptor function is subject to extensive allosteric regulation both by endogenous compounds and by exogenous small molecules. Elucidating the structural determinants and mechanism of action by which allosteric regulators control gating will enhance our understanding of NMDA receptor activation and facilitate the development of novel therapeutics. Here, we investigated the structural determinants for (3-chlorophenyl)(6,7-dimethoxy-1-((4-methoxyphenoxy)methyl)-3,4-dihydroisoquinolin-2(1H)-yl)methanone (CIQ), a GluN2C/2D-selective positive allosteric modulator. We show that CIQ does not bind to the amino-terminal domain of the NMDA receptor and does not share structural determinants with modulators acting at the agonist-binding domain dimer interface or ion channel pore. Rather, we identified critical determinants of CIQ modulation in the region near the first transmembrane helix of GluN2D, including in a putative pre-M1 cuff helix that may influence channel gating. We also show that mutations within the GluN2D pre-M1 region alter open probability of the NMDA receptor. These results suggest a novel site of action for potentiation of NMDA receptors by small molecules and implicate the pre-M1 region in NMDA receptor gating.",

In the current study, we reveal the inhibitory effects of baicalin on the metabolism of dextromethorphan (DXM), a dual probe substrate of CYP2D and CYP3A, in rats. Lineweaver-Burk plots demonstrated that baicalin inhibited the activities of CYP2D and CYP3A in a non-competitive manner in rat liver microsomes (RLMs). Concomitant administration of baicalin (0.90g/kg, i.v.) and DXM (10mg/kg, i.v.) increased the maximum drug concentration (Cmax) (37%) and the area under concentration-time curve (AUC) (42%) and decreased the clearance (CL) (27%) of DXM in a randomised, crossover study in rats (P<0.01). The change in the AUC of DXM was significantly correlated with the Cmax and AUC of baicalin (P<0.05). The inhibitory effects of multiple doses of baicalin (0.90g/kg, i.v., 12days) on the metabolism of DXM were similar to those observed following a single dose in rats. The activity of CYP3A in excised liver samples from rats following multiple baicalin treatment was significantly decreased compared to that of the control group (P<0.05), whereas multiple doses of baicalin had no obvious effect on the activity of CYP2D. Taken together, these data demonstrate that baicalin inhibits the metabolism of DXM in a concentration-dependent manner in rats, possibly through inhibiting hepatic CYP2D and CYP3A activities.",

Accordingly, PTN-/- and MK-/- mice show an increased vulnerability to amphetamine-induced neurotoxic effects. In an effort to uncover new pharmacological targets to prevent amphetamine neurotoxic effects, we have now used a proteomic approach to study protein phosphorylation, in which we combined phosphoprotein enrichment, by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC), with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, in order to identify the phosphoproteins regulated in the striatum of PTN-/-, MK-/- and wild type (WT) mice treated with amphetamine. We identified 13 differentially expressed phosphoproteins that are judged to be relevant in the neuroprotective roles of PTN and MK against amphetamine-induced neurotoxicity. It is very interesting to note that 4 of these phosphoproteins, annexin A7 (ANXA7), COP9 signalosome subunit 5 (COPS5), aldehyde dehydrogenase family 1 member A1 (ALDH1A1) and creatine kinase U-type (CKMT1), are known to be involved in Parkinson's disease, a result of significant importance since PTN and MK have been also demonstrated to limit Parkinson's disease (PD) progress and have been suggested to be among the important genetic factors possibly preventing the development of PD in methamphetamine abusers. The data identify phosphoproteins differentially regulated by amphetamine treatment and/or the presence of endogenous PTN/MK which may be relevant mediators of PTN/MK neuroprotective effects against amphetamine-induced neurotoxicity.

It was therefore of interest to investigate the effects of these oxysterols on oligodendrocytes, the myelin-forming cells in the CNS. To this end, 158N murine oligodendrocytes were treated with 7KC or 7\u03b2OHC inducing an apoptotic mode of cell death characterized by condensation/fragmentation of the nuclei, dephosphorylation of Akt and GSK3, mitochondrial depolarization involving Mcl-1, and caspase-3 activation. In contrast, under treatment with 27-hydroxycholesterol (27OHC), no cell death was observed. When the cells were stained with Fura-2, no significant Ca(2+) rise was found with the different oxysterols, whereas strong signals were detected with ionomycin used as positive control. At concentrations which induced apoptosis, 7KC but not 7\u03b2OHC accumulated in lipid rafts. Although not cytotoxic, 27OHC was mainly detected in lipid rafts. It is noteworthy that \u03b1-tocopherol (but not ellagic acid and resveratrol) was able to counteract 7KC- and 7\u03b2OHC-induced apoptosis and to decrease the accumulation of 7KC and 27OHC in lipid rafts. Thus, in 158N cells, the ability of oxysterols to trigger a mode of cell death by apoptosis involving GSK-3 and caspase-3 activation is independent of the increase in the Ca(2+) level and of their accumulation in lipid raft microdomains.",

OBJECTIVE: In the present study, the effects of systemic injection of the newly synthesized H3R antagonist ST1283 on ethanol (EtOH) voluntary intake and EtOH-conditioned reward in mice have been investigated. METHODS: Oral EtOH, saccharin, and quinine intake was assessed in a two-bottle choice paradigm using escalating concentrations of alcohol or tastant solutions. EtOH-induced place preference (CPP), EtOH-induced locomotor activity, and blood ethanol concentration (BEC) were also measured. RESULTS: Following administration of the H3R antagonist (2.5, 5, and 10\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.), there was a significant dose-dependent decrease in alcohol consumption and preference. Importantly, vehicle- and ST1283 (5\u00a0mg/kg)-treated mice showed similar consumption and preference to increasing concentration of both sweet and bitter tastes. More interestingly, systemic administration of ST1283 inhibited EtOH-CPP and EtOH-enhanced locomotion. This inhibition was blocked when mice were pretreated with the selective H3R agonist R-(alpha)-methyl-histamine (10\u00a0mg/kg). Finally, vehicle- and ST1283-treated mice had similar BECs. CONCLUSION: Our results show that ST1283 may decrease voluntary EtOH consumption and EtOH-CPP by altering its reinforcing effects, suggesting a novel role for histamine signaling in regulation of alcoholism. Lastly, the results add to the growing literature on H3R modulation in the pharmacotherapy of EtOH addiction.",

        "input": "The small GTPase Rac1 has been widely implicated in mammary tumorigenesis and metastasis. Previous studies established that stimulation of ErbB receptors in breast cancer cells activates Rac1 and enhances motility via the Rac-guanine nucleotide exchange factor P-Rex1. As the Janus tyrosine kinase 2 (Jak2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) pathway has been shown to be functionally associated with ErbB receptors, we asked if this pathway could mediate P-Rex1/Rac1 activation in response to ErbB ligands. Here we found that the anticancer agent cucurbitacin I, a Jak2 inhibitor, reduced the activation of Rac1 and motility in response to the ErbB3 ligand heregulin in breast cancer cells. However, Rac1 activation was not affected by Jak2 or Stat3 RNA interference, suggesting that the effect of cucurbitacin I occurs through a Jak2-independent mechanism. Cucurbitacin I also failed to affect the activation of P-Rex1 by heregulin. Subsequent analysis revealed that cucurbitacin I strongly activates RhoA and the Rho effector Rho kinase (ROCK) in breast cancer cells and induces the formation of stress fibers. Interestingly, disruption of the RhoA-ROCK pathway prevented the inhibitory effect of cucurbitacin I on Rac1 activation by heregulin. Lastly, we found that RhoA activation by cucurbitacin I is mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). The ROS scavenger N-acetyl l-cysteine and the mitochondrial antioxidant Mito-TEMPO rescued the inhibitory effect of cucurbitacin I on Rac1 activation. In conclusion, these results indicate that ErbB-driven Rac1 activation in breast cancer cells proceeds independently of the Jak2 pathway. Moreover, they established that the inhibitory effect of cucurbitacin I on Rac1 activity involves the alteration of the balance between Rho and Rac.",

Excess lipids in peripheral tissues - skeletal muscle, liver and adipose tissue - may attenuate insulin signaling through the protein kinase B (AKt) pathway and up-regulate protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), a negative regulator of insulin signaling. We studied accumulation of lipid metabolites [triglycerides (TAGs), diglycerides (DAGs)] and ceramides in relation to insulin signaling and expression and phosphorylation of PTP1B by preincubating rat skeletal muscle cells (L6 myotubes) with three saturated and three unsaturated free fatty acids (FFAs) (200 \u03bcM). Cells were also evaluated in the presence of wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases and thus AKt (0-100 nM). Unsaturated FFAs increased DAGs, TAGs and PTP1B expression significantly, but cells remained insulin sensitive as assessed by robust AKt and PTP1B phosphorylation at serine (Ser) 50, Ser 398 and tyrosine 152. Saturated palmitic and stearic acids increased ceramides, up-regulated PTP1B, and had AKt and PTP1B phosphorylation at Ser 50 impaired. We show a significant correlation between phosphorylation levels of AKt and of PTP1B at Ser 50 (R(2)=0.84, P<.05). The same was observed with increasing wortmannin dose (R(2)=0.73, P<.05). Only FFAs that increased ceramides caused impairment of AKt and PTP1B phosphorylation at Ser 50. PTP1B overexpression in the presence of excess lipids may not directly cause insulin resistance unless it is accompanied by decreased PTP1B phosphorylation. A clear relationship between PTP1B phosphorylation levels at Ser 50 and its negative effect on insulin signaling is shown.",

Eight ARBs are clinically available [azilsartan, candesartan, eprosartan, irbesartan, losartan, olmesartan, telmisartan, valsartan]. Azilsartan (in some countries), candesartan, and olmesartan are orally administered as prodrugs, whereas the blocking action of some is mediated through active metabolites. On the basis of their chemical structures, ARBs use different binding pockets in the receptor, which are associated with differences in dissociation times and, in most cases, apparently insurmountable antagonism. The physicochemical differences between ARBs also manifest in different tissue penetration, including passage through the blood-brain barrier. Differences in binding mode and tissue penetration are also associated with differences in pharmacokinetic profile, particularly duration of action. Although generally highly specific for angiotensin II type 1 receptors, some ARBs, particularly telmisartan, are partial agonists at peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3. All of these properties are comprehensively reviewed in this article. Although there is general consensus that a continuous receptor blockade over a 24-hour period is desirable, the clinical relevance of other pharmacological differences between individual ARBs remains to be assessed.",

        "input": "Excellent glycaemic control is essential in pregnancy to optimise maternal and foetal outcomes. The aim of this review is to assess the efficacy and safety of insulin analogues in pregnancy. Insulin lispro and insulin aspart are safe in pregnancy and may improve post-prandial glycaemic control in women with type 1 diabetes. However, a lack of data indicating improved foetal outcomes would suggest that there is no imperative to switch to a short-acting analogue where the woman's diabetes is well controlled with human insulin. There are no reports of the use of insulin glulisine in pregnancy and so its use cannot be recommended. Most studies of insulin glargine in pregnancy are small, retrospective and include women with pre-existing diabetes and gestational diabetes. There appear to be no major safety concerns and so it seems reasonable to continue insulin glargine if required to achieve excellent glycaemic control. A head-to-head comparison between insulin detemir and NPH insulin in women with type 1 diabetes showed that while foetal outcomes did not differ, fasting plasma glucose improved with insulin detemir without an increased incidence of hypoglycaemia. The greater evidence base supports the use of insulin detemir as the first line long-acting analogue in pregnancy but the lack of definitive foetal benefits means that there is no strong need to switch a woman who is well controlled on NPH insulin. There seems little justification in using long acting insulin analogues in women with gestational diabetes or type 2 diabetes where the risk of hypoglycaemia is low.",

        "input": "The murine neuronal facilitative glucose transporter isoform 3 (Glut3) is developmentally regulated, peaking in expression at postnatal day (PN)14. In the present study, we characterized a canonical CpG island spanning the 5'-flanking region of the glut3 gene. Methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite sequencing identified methylation of this CpG ((m)CpG) island of the glut3 gene, frequency of methylation increasing 2.5-fold with a 1.6-fold increase in DNA methyl transferase 3a concentrations noted with advancing postnatal age (PN14 vs PN3). 5'-flanking region of glut3-luciferase reporter transient transfection in HT22 hippocampal neurons demonstrated that (m)CpGs inhibit glut3 transcription. Contrary to this biological function, glut3 expression rises synchronously with (m)CpGs in PN14 vs PN3 neurons. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (IP) revealed that methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (Mecp2) bound the glut3-(m)CpGs. Depending on association with specific coregulators, Mecp2, a dual regulator of gene transcription, may repress or activate a downstream gene. Sequential chromatin IP uncovered the glut3-(m)CpGs to bind Mecp2 exponentially upon recruitment of Creb1 rather than histone deacetylase 1. Co-IP and coimmunolocalization confirmed that Creb1 associated with Mecp2 and cotransfection with glut3-(m)CpG in HT22 cells enhanced glut3 transcription. Separate 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine pretreatment or in combination with trichostatin A reduced (m)CpG and specific small interference RNAs targeting Mecp2 and Creb1 separately or together depleting Mecp2 and/or Creb1 binding of glut3-(m)CpGs reduced glut3 expression in HT22 cells. We conclude that Glut3 is a methylation-sensitive neuronal gene that recruits Mecp2. Recruitment of Creb1-Mecp2 by glut3-(m)CpG contributes towards transactivation, formulating an escape from (m)CpG-induced gene suppression, and thereby promoting developmental neuronal glut3 gene transcription and expression.",

In the in vitro assay, kinsenoside (20 and 50\u03bcg/mL) markedly inhibited changes in various biochemical substances (nitric oxide (NO), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT)) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) damaged by high glucose (35mM) and restored vascular endothelial structure by balancing the matrix metalloproteinases-the tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-TIMP) system. The vascular protective effects of kinsenoside were speculated to be attributed to oxidative stress inhibition and the reduction of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) mRNA expression levels in high glucose conditions. Moreover, histological examination, including hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining, masson trichrome (Masson) staining, and periodic Schiff-methenamine (PASM) staining, greatly supported the morphological and functional amelioration of diabetes-related changes in mice aortas after kinsenoside (20 and 50\u03bcg/mL) treatment.

The mechanisms by which oxysterols may influence proliferation are manifold: they control the transcription and the turnover of the key enzyme in cholesterol synthesis, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase, by binding to Insig-1, Insig-2 and liver X receptors. Oxysterols are thought to be generated in proportion to the rate of cholesterol synthesis. Although there is no consensus about the mechanism by which these oxysterols are generated in vivo, it clearly has to be ubiquitous. The 25- and the 27-cholesterol hydroxylases, present in almost all tissues, are possible candidates. Cholesterol uptake from lipoproteins, intracellular vesicle transport and lipid transfer are also modified by oxysterols. Oxysterols interfere with ERK, hedgehog and wnt pathways of proliferation and differentiation. When administered in vitro to cancer cell lines, oxysterols invariably both slow down proliferation and provoke cell death. Perhaps is it sufficient to stop proliferation of a cancer to provoke its eradication. Therefore, the two facets of oxysterol action that seem important for cancer treatment, cytostaticity and cytotoxicity, will be discussed.",

Treatment with Fc11a-2 dose-dependently attenuated the loss of body weight and shortening of colon length induced by DSS. In addition, the disease activity index, histopathologic scores and myeloperoxidase activity were also significantly reduced by Fc11a-2 treatment. Moreover, protein and mRNA levels of DSS-induced proinflammatory cytokines in colon, including TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-18, IL-17A and IFN-\u03b3, were markedly suppressed by Fc11a-2. Furthermore, a decreased CD11c(+) macrophage infiltration in colons and inactivation of caspase-1 in peritoneal macrophages were detected in Fc11a-2-treated mice. The mechanism of action of Fc11a-2 was related to the inhibition of the cleavage of pro-caspase-1, pro-IL-1\u03b2 and pro-IL-18 which in turn suppressed the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome.

Research in this field has been substantially promoted by the evidence that the reuptake protein (SERT), present in presynaptic neurons, is a key element in terminating the activity of the neurotransmitter in the synaptic cleft. For this reason, it was specifically targeted for the development of second-generation antidepressants, in particular of selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), with the aim of increasing the intrasynaptic 5-HT concentrations. Moreover, since a lot of studies showed that circulating platelets and, more recently, lymphocytes possess functional SERT proteins, they have been widely used as peripheral mirrors of the same structures located in the central nervous system. The presence of functional SERT in blood cells suggests strict relationships between the nervous and the immune system that need to be better clarified in MD, as well as the possibility of reciprocal modulation of the two systems by different drugs. This paper aims to review briefly the literature on the 5-HT hypothesis of depression with a major focus on the possible role of SERT in this disorder, while highlighting how recent data are more oriented on dimensional rather than nosological involvement of this structure in different conditions spanning from normality to pathology.",

        "input": "Fisetin, a flavonol present in vegetables and fruits, possesses antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. In this study, we have demonstrated that fisetin prevents diet-induced obesity through regulation of the signaling of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a central mediator of cellular growth, cellular proliferation and lipid biosynthesis. To evaluate whether fisetin regulates mTORC1 signaling, we investigated the phosphorylation and kinase activity of the 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) and mTORC1 in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Fisetin treatment of preadipocytes reduced the phosphorylation of S6K1 and mTORC1 in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. To further our understanding of how fisetin negatively regulates mTORC1 signaling, we analyzed the phosphorylation of S6K1, mTOR and Akt in fisetin-treated TSC2-knockdown cells. The results suggested that fisetin treatment inhibits mTORC1 activity in an Akt-dependent manner. Recent studies have shown that adipocyte differentiation is dependent on mTORC1 activity. Fisetin treatment inhibited adipocyte differentiation, consistent with the negative effect of fisetin on mTOR. The inhibitory effect of fisetin on adipogenesis is dependent of mTOR activity, suggesting that fisetin inhibits adipogenesis and the accumulation of intracellular triglycerides during adipocyte differentiation by targeting mTORC1 signaling. Fisetin supplementation in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) significantly attenuated HFD-induced increases in body weight and white adipose tissue. We also observed that fisetin efficiently suppressed the phosphorylation of Akt, S6K1 and mTORC1 in adipose tissue. Collectively, these results suggest that inhibition of mTORC1 signaling by fisetin prevents adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and obesity in HFD-fed mice. Therefore, fisetin may be a useful phytochemical agent for attenuating diet-induced obesity.",

Recent studies indicate that PXR may also play an important role in the regulation of lipid homeostasis. In the present study, we identified amprenavir, a widely used HIV PI, as a potent PXR-selective agonist. Computational docking studies combined with site-direct mutagenesis identified several key residues within the ligand binding pocket of PXR that constitute points of interaction with amprenavir. Amprenavir efficiently activated PXR and induced PXR target gene expression in vitro and in vivo. Short-term exposure to amprenavir significantly increased plasma total cholesterol and atherogenic low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in wild-type mice, but not in PXR-deficient mice. Amprenavir-mediated PXR activation stimulated the expression of several key intestinal genes involved in lipid homeostasis.

METHODS: Rats were divided into 7 groups; control (corn oil, gavage), DZN (15mg/kg/day, gavage,), crocin (12.5, 25 or 50mg/kg/day, i.p) plus DZN, vitamin E (200IU/kg, i.p, three times per week) plus DZN and crocin (50mg/kg/day, i.p) groups. Treatments were continued for 4weeks. Creatine phosphokinase MB (CK-MB), malondealdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) levels were evaluated in heart tissue at the end of treatments. Levels of apoptotic proteins (Bax, Bcl2, caspase 3) and cytosolic cytochrome c were analyzed by Western blotting. Transcript levels of Bax and Bcl2 were also determined using qRT PCR. RESULTS: DZN induced histophatological damages and elevated the level of cardiac marker CK-MB. These effects were associated with increased MDA level, lower level of reduced GSH and induction of apoptosis through elevation of Bax/Bcl2 ratio (both protein and mRNA levels), cytochrome c release to the cytosol and activation caspase 3 in cardiac tissue. Crocin (25 and 50mg/kg) or vitamin E improved histopathological damages, decreased MDA and CK-MB, increased GSH content and attenuated the increase of Bax/Bcl2 ratio, activation of caspase 3 and release of cytochrome c to the cytosol induced by DZN. In summary, DZN induced mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis in heart tissue of rat following subchronic exposure. Crocin, as an antioxidant, showed protective effects against DZN cardiotoxicity by reducing lipid peroxidation and alleviating apoptosis.",

Constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) translocates into the nucleus in accordance with 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase and thus confers transactivation. The aim of the present study was to investigate a possible link between CAR and HIF\u03b1. Phenobarbital (PB), a typical CAR activator, increased the gene expression of HIF-target genes in the livers of mice, including erythropoietin, heme oxygenase-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor-a. PB induced an accumulation of nuclear HIF-1\u03b1 and an increase in the HIF-responsive element-mediated transactivation in HepG2 cells. Cobalt chloride, a typical HIF activator, induced the gene expression of CAR-target genes, including cyp2b9 and cyp2b10, an accumulation of nuclear CAR and an increase in the PB-responsive enhancer module-mediated transactivation in the mouse liver. Immunoprecipitation-immunoblot and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses suggest that CAR binds to the PB-responsive enhancer module with HIF-1\u03b1 in the liver of untreated mice and that the complex dissociates upon PB treatment.

Five classes of chalcogenopyrylium dyes (CGPs) were examined for their ability to modulate transport of [(3)H]estradiol glucuronide (E217\u03b2G) (a prototypical MRP substrate) into MRP-enriched inside-out membrane vesicles. Additionally, some CGPs were tested in intact transfected cells using a calcein efflux assay. Sixteen of 34 CGPs inhibited MRP1-mediated E217\u03b2G uptake by >50% (IC50's 0.7-7.6 \u03bcM). Of 9 CGPs with IC50's \u22642 \u03bcM, two belonged to Class I, two to Class III and five to Class V. When tested in the intact cells, only 4 of 16 CGPs (at 10 \u03bcM) inhibited MRP1-mediated calcein efflux by >50% (III-1, V-3, -4, -6) while a fifth (I-5) inhibited efflux by just 23%. These five CGPs also inhibited [(3)H]E217\u03b2G uptake by MRP4. In contrast, their effects on MRP2 varied with two (V-4, V-6) inhibiting E217\u03b2G transport (IC50's 2.0, 9.2 \u03bcM), two (V-3, III-1) stimulating transport (>2-fold), while CGP I-5 had no effect. Strikingly, although V-3 and V-4 had opposite effects on MRP2 activity, they are structurally identical except for their chalcogen atom (Se versus Te). This study is the first to identify Class V CGPs with their distinctive methine or trimethine linkage between two disubstituted pyrylium moieties as a particularly potent class of MRP modulators and also show that within this core structure, differences in the electronegativity associated with a chalcogen atom can be the sole determinant of whether a compound will stimulate or inhibit MRP2.",

        "input": "Background: Anaplastic thyroid cancers (ATC) represent only 1-2% of all thyroid tumors, but they account for up to 50% of the mortality. Treatment of differentiated thyroid carcinomas is well standardized and the use of radioiodine represents an essential step; in contrast, there is no standardized therapeutic approach for anaplastic tumors and their prognosis is poor. The resistance of anaplastic thyroid cancer to radioiodine treatment is principally due to the absence of expression of the sodium iodide symporter (NIS), mainly due to epigenetic silencing. The acetylation status of histones is involved in the epigenetic control of gene expression and is usually disrupted in advanced thyroid cancer. Histone deacetylase inhibitors have been demonstrated as potent anticancer drugs with several different effects on cell viability and differentiation. Methods: Stabilized anaplastic thyroid cancer cell lines (BHT-101 and CAL-62) and primary cultures from patients who underwent thyroidectomy for anaplastic thyroid cancer were treated with the histone deacetylase inhibitor LBH589. After treatment, we evaluated the expression and function of NIS. Gene expression was evaluated by real-time PCR (RT-PCR); NIS promoter activity was determined with a luciferase reporter assay; and protein expression was assessed through immunofluorescence. We tested the protein function by 125I uptake and efflux experiments; finally the cytotoxic effect of 131I was determined with a clonogenic assay. Results: Our results demonstrate that treatment with LBH589 leads to NIS RNA expression as shown by RT-PCR and luciferase assay, and to protein expression as determined by immunofluorescence in vitro and by immunohistochemistry in xenograft tumors. Moreover, 125I uptake and efflux experiments show the correct protein function and iodine retention, that translate into cytotoxicity effects, as demonstrated by a clonogenic assay with 131I . Conclusions: This study supplies a new potential strategy for the treatment of ATC by modifying gene expression with the aim of inducing responsiveness towards radioiodine therapy.",

        "input": "Human Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide 2B1 (OATP2B1) is a membrane transporter that facilitates the cellular uptake of a number of endogenous compounds and drugs. OATP2B1 is widely expressed in tissues including the small intestine, liver, kidney, placenta, heart, skeletal muscle and platelets. Recently, it has been shown that differential promoter usage in tissues results in expression of five OATP2B1 transcriptional start site variants which utilize distinct first exons but share common subsequent exons. These variants are expected to encode either a full length (OATP2B1-FL) or shortened protein lacking 22 N-terminus amino acids (OATP2B-Short). Little is known regarding the transport activity and regulation of OATP2B1 variants with N-terminus truncation. Here, using absolute quantitative polymerase chain reaction we find the full length variant is the major form expressed in duodenum but the short variant predominates in liver. Using a transient heterologous cell expression system, we find that the transport activities of the short OATP2B1 variant towards substrates estrone sulfate and rosuvastatin are similar to the well-characterized full length variant. Transcriptional activity screening of the liver enriched OATP2B1 variant promoter identified hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4\u03b1) as a novel transacting factor. With a combination of in silico screening, promoter mutation in cell-based reporter assays, siRNA knockdown and chromatin immunoprecipitation studies, we identified a functional HNF4\u03b1 binding site close to the transcription start site (-17 to -4 bp). We conclude that the major OATP2B1 protein form in liver is transport competent and its hepatic expression is regulated by HNF4\u03b1.",

We aimed to document the capability (response) of adrenal gland to secrete cortisol and DHEA-S during hyperthyroidism compared to euthyroidism, and to describe factors associated with these responses. A standard-dose (0.25\u00a0mg/i.v.) ACTH stimulation test was performed to the same patients before hyperthyroidism treatment, and after attainment of euthyroidism. Baseline cortisol (Cor0), DHEA-S (DHEA-S0), cortisol binding globulin (CBG), ACTH, calculated free cortisol (by Coolen's equation\u00a0=\u00a0CFC), free cortisol index (FCI), 60-min cortisol (Cor60), and DHEA-S (DHEA-S60), delta cortisol (\u0394Cor), delta DHEA-S (\u0394DHEA-S) responses were evaluated. Forty-one patients [22 females, 49.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015.2\u00a0years old, 32 Graves disease, nine toxic nodular goiter] had similar Cor0, DHEA-S0, CFC, FCI, and DHEA-S60 in hyperthyroid and euthyroid states. Cor60, \u0394Cor, and \u0394DHEA-S were lower in hyperthyroidism. In four (10\u00a0%) patients the peak ACTH-stimulated cortisol values were lower than 18\u00a0\u03bcg/dL. When the test repeated after attainment of euthyroidism, all of the patients had normal cortisol response. Regression analysis demonstrated an independent association of Cor60 with free T3 in hyperthyroidism. However, the predictors of CFC, FCI, and DHEA-S levels were serum creatinine levels in hyperthyroidism, and both creatinine and transaminase levels in euthyroidism. ACTH-stimulated peak cortisol, delta cortisol, and delta DHEA-S levels are decreased during hyperthyroidism, probably due to increased turnover. Since about 10\u00a0% of the subjects with hyperthyroidism are at risk for adrenal insufficiency, clinicians dealing with Graves' disease should be alert to the possibility of adrenal insufficiency during hyperthyroid stage.",

We aimed to develop fluorescent probes to target the GluN2B subunit selectively in order to allow better understanding of the relationships between receptor localisation and physiological importance. Ifenprodil, known as the GluNR2B antagonist of reference, was chosen as the template for the elaboration of probes. We had previously reported a fluorescein conjugate that was shown (by confocal microscopy imaging of DS-red-labelled cortical neurons) to bind specifically to GluN2B. To elaborate this probe, we explored the influence of both the nature and the attachment point of the spacer between the fluorophore and the parent compound, ifenprodil. We performed chemical modifications of ifenprodil at the benzylic position and on the phenol ring by introducing secondary amine or amide functions and evaluated alkyl chains from two to 20 bonds either including or not including secondary amide functions as spacers. The previously developed probe was found to display the greatest activity in the inhibition of NMDA-induced Ca(2+) influx by calcium imaging experiments on HEK293 cells transfected with the cDNA encoding for GluN1-1A and GluN2B. Further investigations revealed that this probe had a neuroprotective effect equivalent to that of ifenprodil in a standard test for neurotoxicity.

These compounds interact with voltage-gated sodium, potassium and calcium channels and modulate the flux of these ions into various cell types. This review provides a summary of marine neurotoxins, including their structures, molecular targets and pharmacologies. Saxitoxin and its derivatives, collectively referred to as paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs), are unique among neurotoxins in that they are found in both marine and freshwater environments by organisms inhabiting two kingdoms of life. Prokaryotic cyanobacteria are responsible for PST production in freshwater systems, while eukaryotic dinoflagellates are the main producers in marine waters. Bioaccumulation by filter-feeding bivalves and fish and subsequent transfer through the food web results in the potentially fatal human illnesses, paralytic shellfish poisoning and saxitoxin pufferfish poisoning. These illnesses are a result of saxitoxin's ability to bind to the voltage-gated sodium channel, blocking the passage of nerve impulses and leading to death via respiratory paralysis. Recent advances in saxitoxin research are discussed, including the molecular biology of toxin synthesis, new protein targets, association with metal-binding motifs and methods of detection.

We previously gave evidence that melanocortins afford cardioprotection in conditions of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion. Here we aimed to investigate the influence of melanocortins on the JAK/ERK/STAT signaling in cardiac and systemic responses to prolonged myocardial ischemia/reperfusion. Ischemia was produced in rats by ligature of the left anterior descending coronary artery for 30min. At the end of the 2-h reperfusion, western blot analysis of the cardioprotective transcription factors pJAK2, pERK1/2, pTyr-STAT3 and pSer-STAT3, the inflammatory mediator tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), the pro-apoptotic factors BAX and c-jun N-terminal kinases (pJNK), the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-XL, as well as of the cardioprotective enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), was performed in the left ventricle and spleen. Intravenous treatment, during coronary artery occlusion, with the melanocortin analogs [Nle(4), D-Phe(7)]\u03b1-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (NDP-\u03b1-MSH) and adrenocorticotropic hormone 1-24 [ACTH-(1-24)], induced a left ventricle up-regulation of pJAK2, pERK1/2 and pTyr-STAT3 (JAK-dependent), and a reduction in pJNK and TNF-\u03b1 levels; these effects of NDP-\u03b1-MSH and ACTH-(1-24) were associated with over-expression of the pro-survival proteins HO-1 and Bcl-XL, and marked decrease of the myocardial infarct size. Melanocortin treatment did not affect left ventricle pSer-STAT3 (ERK1/2-dependent) and BAX levels. In the spleen, NDP-\u03b1-MSH and ACTH-(1-24) induced similar effects on the expression of the above transcription factors/proteins, except for pERK1/2 (down-regulated) and HO-1 (unaffected). Blockade of JAK and ERK pathways with AG490 and U0126, respectively, abrogated the myocardial infarct size reduction by NDP-\u03b1-MSH.

Liganded-CAR induced CYP2B6 mRNA in human primary hepatocytes far more effectively than in HepG2 cells ectopically expressing CAR. Here, we have now found that activation of p38 MAPK by anisomycin potentiated induction of CYP2B6 mRNA by CAR ligand in HepG2 cells to levels observed in ligand-treated human primary hepatocytes. siRNA knockdown of p38 MAPK abrogated the ability of anisomycin to synergistically induce CYP2B6 mRNA. In addition to CYP2B6, anisomycin co-treatment potentiated an increase in CYP2A7 and CYP2C9 mRNAs but not CYP3A4 or UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 mRNAs. Thus, activated p38 MAPK is required for liganded-CAR to selectively activate a set of genes that encode drug metabolizing enzymes. Our present results suggest that CAR-mediated induction of these enzymes can not be understood by ligand binding alone because the specificity and magnitude of induction are co-determined by a given cell signaling such as p38 MAPK; both physiological and pathophysiological states of cell signaling may have a strong impact in hepatic drug metabolizing capability during therapeutic treatments.",

FCEO significantly inhibited nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) by suppressing the protein expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, respectively. Additionally, FCEO suppressed the production of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, and IL-6. FCEO attenuated LPS-induced nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) activation via inhibition of inhibitor \u03baB-\u03b1 phosphorylation. Furthermore, FCEO blocked activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) but not that of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase.

AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of ethanolic extracts of Adiantum capillus-veneris L. and the involvement of NF-\u03baB signaling in the regulation of inflammation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The plant ethanolic extracts were initially tested against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production in RAW264.7 mouse macrophages, and interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production in human U937 monocytes. The effect of the plant extracts on the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) pathway was evaluated in TNF-\u03b1 stimulated HepG2 cells by luciferase gene reporter assay and Western blotting at the transcriptional and translational levels. Subsequently, the inhibition of NF-\u03baB downstream gene expression (IL-8 and ICAM-1) by the plant extracts was assessed via quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Lastly, the anti-inflammatory activities of the plant extracts in vivo were evaluated by testing spleen index and NF-\u03baB related protein expression in LPS-stimulated CD1 mice. RESULTS: The plant ethanolic extracts effectively suppressed PGE2, IL-6 and TNF release with an IC50 less than 50\u03bcg/ml. Moreover, luciferase expression could be specifically blocked in HepG2 cells, not in HEK293 cells, showing that the plant extracts displayed a cell-specific pattern on NF-\u03baB gene transcription. The assayed biological activity also depended on the order of adding TNF-\u03b1 and the plant extracts because the plant extracts could only block the NF-\u03baB activation if added earlier but were unable to stop the signal when added after TNF-\u03b1. However, the plant extracts did not exert any effect on ubiquitination which regulates several steps in the NF-\u03baB pathway. Additionally, the plant extracts down-regulated phosphorylation of IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 at S176/180, p38 at T180/Y182 and p65 at S536, but not p65 at S276. This was confirmed by their ability to selectively abrogate the induction of IL-8 transcription, whereas the ICAM-1 gene, which is not transcribed selectively by an NF-\u03baB complex containing a form of p65 phosphorylated on Ser536, did not change. Finally, the plant extracts at 200\u03bcg/mg could normalize the LPS-induced elevation of spleen index as well as NF-\u03baB and p38 activations in CD1 mice. CONCLUSION: The present studies presents the potential utilization of this plant extracts, as a natural resources for the development of an anti-inflammatory medicine.",

In addition, 5HHMF blocked LPS-induced phosphorylation of I\u03baB, resulting in suppression of the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) subunits, namely p65 and p50, which are important molecules involved in the regulation of iNOS expression. Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), a specific NF-\u03baB inhibitor, along with 20S proteasome inhibitor (PSI) significantly inhibited LPS-induced iNOS expression, which indirectly suggested that 5HHMF downregulated iNOS expression by suppressing NF-\u03baB activity. Thus, we found that 5HHMF enhances heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression via nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) activation. In addition, cobalt protoporphyrin (CoPP), a specific HO-1 inducer, predominantly suppressed LPS-induced NO production. In contrast, zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP), a specific HO-1 inhibitor, showed a partial suppressive effect of 5HHMF on LPS-induced NO production. Further, 5HHMF increased specific DNA-binding activity of Nrf2, and transient knockdown with Nrf2 siRNA subsequently reversed 5HHMF-induced NO inhibition, which was followed by suppression of HO-1 activity. Taken together, our findings indicate that 5HHMF suppresses NO production through modulation of iNOS, consequently suppressing NF-\u03baB activity and induction of Nrf2-dependent HO-1 activity.",

Its use is limited by the development of resistance, often rationalized via effects on cellular uptake. It has been claimed that hCTR1, the human high affinity copper transporter, is the major entry pathway for cDDP and related drugs via a mechanism that mimics copper. This is an unexpected property of hCTR1, a highly selective copper (I) transporter. We compared the uptake rates of copper with cDDP (and several analogs) into HEK293 cells over-expressing wild-type or mutant hCTR1, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (mefs) that do or do not express CTR1, and human ovarian tumor cells, sensitive or resistant to cDDP. We have also compared the effects of extracellular copper, which causes regulatory endocytosis of hCTR1, to those of cDDP. We confirm the correlation between higher hCTR1 levels and higher Pt-drug uptake in tumor cells sensitive to the drug. However, we show that hCTR1 is not the major entry route of platinum-drugs and that the copper transporter is not internalized in response to extracellular drug. Our data suggest the major entry pathway for platinum-drugs is not saturable at relevant concentrations and not protein-mediated. Clinical trials have been initiated that depend upon regulating membrane levels of hCTR1. If reduced drug uptake is a major factor in resistance, hCTR1 is unlikely to be a productive target in attempts to enhance efficacy, although the proteins involved in copper homeostasis may play a role.",

Here we report the solution structure of the SH2 domain of C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) in complex with a longer phosphopeptide from Csk-binding protein (Cbp). This structure, together with biochemical experiments, revealed the existence of a novel binding region in addition to the canonical phosphotyrosine-314 binding site of Cbp. Mutational analysis of this second region in cells showed that both canonical and novel binding sites are required for tumor suppression through the Cbp-Csk interaction.

However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon are poorly understood. The current study determines the role of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) in human leukemic U937 cells apoptosis induced by 2-hydroxy-3-methylanthraquinone from H. diffusa. Our results showed that 2-hydroxy-3-methylanthraquinone decreased phosphorylation-ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2), and increased p-p38MAPK, but did not affect expressions of p-JNK1/2 in U937 cells. Moreover, treatment of U937 cells with 2-hydroxy-3-methylanthraquinone resulted in activation of caspase-3. Furthermore, PD98059 (ERK1/2 inhibitor) significantly enhanced 2-hydroxy-3-methylanthraquinone-induced apoptosis in U937 cells, whereas caspase-3 inhibitor or SB203580 (p-p38MAPK inhibitor), decreased apoptosis in U937 cells. Taken together, our study for the first time suggests that 2-hydroxy-3-methylanthraquinone is able to enhance apoptosis of U937 cells, at least in part, through activation of p-p38MAPK and downregulation of p-ERK1/2.

However, the relative contribution from each enzyme remains controversial. The CYP2B6*6 allele is associated with reduced enzyme expression and activity that may lead to interindividual variability in ketamine metabolism. We examined the N-demethylation of individual ketamine enantiomers using human liver microsomes (HLMs) genotyped for the CYP2B6*6 allele, insect cell expressed recombinant CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 enzymes and COS-1 cell expressed recombinant CYP2B6.1 and CYP2B6.6 protein variant. Effects of CYP-selective inhibitors on norketamine formation were also determined in HLMs. The two-enzyme Michaelis-Menten model best fitted the HLM kinetic data. The Km value for the high affinity enzyme and the low affinity enzyme were similar to those for the expressed CYP2B6 and CYP3A4, respectively. The intrinsic clearance for both ketamine enantiomers by the high affinity enzyme in HLMs with CYP2B6*1/*1 genotype were at least 2-fold and 6-fold higher, respectively, than those for CYP2B6*1/*6 genotype and CYP2B6*6/*6 genotype.

The objective of the current study was to determine whether a low-dose subchronic DEX treatment (100 \u03bcg/kg for 8 consecutive days) exerts long-term effects on apoptosis in the adult rat prefrontal cortex (PFC) by examining the expression of cell death-promoting molecules (poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), p53, procaspase 3, cleaved caspase 3, Bax) and cell-survival molecules (AKT, Bcl-2). Our results revealed that body, thymus and adrenal weight as well corticosterone level in the serum and PFC were reduced a day following last DEX injection. In PFC, DEX caused activation of AKT, augmentation of pro-survival Bcl-2 protein and enhanced Bcl-2/Bax protein ratio, as well Bcl-2 translocation to mitochondria. The unaltered profile in the protein expression of apoptotic molecules PARP, procaspase 3 and Bax was detected, while the p53 protein was decreased. Results of RT-PCR analysis showed decrease of p53 mRNA level and no significant difference in Bcl-2 and Bax mRNA expressions in DEX-treated rats. Finally, the DNA fragmentation assay and Fluoro-Jade staining demonstrated no considerable changes in the apoptosis in rat PFC. Our findings support the concept that a low-dose DEX creates the hypocorticoid state in the brain and indicate that subchronic DEX treatment activates pro-survival signalling pathway but does not change apoptotic markers in rat PFC.

        "input": "Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by ataxia, variously associating heart disease, diabetes mellitus and/or glucose intolerance. It results from intronic expansion of GAA triplet repeats at the FXN locus. Homozygous expansions cause silencing of the FXN gene and subsequent decreased expression of the encoded mitochondrial frataxin. Detailed analyses in fibroblasts and neuronal tissues from FRDA patients have revealed profound cytoskeleton anomalies. So far, however, the molecular mechanism underlying these cytoskeleton defects remains unknown. We show here that gene silencing spreads in cis over the PIP5K1B gene in cells from FRDA patients (circulating lymphocytes and primary fibroblasts), correlating with expanded GAA repeat size. PIP5K1B encodes phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase \u03b2 type I (pip5k1\u03b2), an enzyme functionally linked to actin cytoskeleton dynamics that phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate [PI(4)P] to generate phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2]. Accordingly, loss of pip5k1\u03b2 function in FRDA cells was accompanied by decreased PI(4,5)P2 levels and was shown instrumental for destabilization of the actin network and delayed cell spreading.

Autophagy is a lysosomal degradation pathway that is essential for cell survival and tissue homeostasis. In this study, the role of autophagy and related signaling pathways during dioscin-induced apoptosis in human lung cancer cells was investigated. Results from 4'-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and annexin-V/PI double-staining assay showed that caspase-3- and caspase-8-dependent, and dose-dependent apoptoses were detected after a 24-h dioscin treatment. Meanwhile, autophagy was detected as early as 12\u00a0h after an exposure to low-dose dioscin, as indicated by an up-regulated expression of LC3-II and beclin-1 proteins. Blockade of autophagy with bafilomycin A1 or 3-methyladenine sensitized the A549 and H1299 cells to apoptosis. Treatment of A549 and H1299 cells with dioscin caused a dose-dependent increase in ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 activity, accompanied with a decreased PI3K expression and decreased phosphorylation of Akt and mTOR. Taken together, this study demonstrated for the first time that autophagy occurred earlier than apoptosis during dioscin-induced human lung cancer cell line apoptosis. Dioscin-induced autophagy via ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 pathways may provide a protective mechanism for cell survival against dioscin-induced apoptosis to act as a cytoprotective reaction.",

Pharmacological doses of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin reduce albuminura in diabetes. We explored the hypothesis that mTOR mediates podocyte injury in diabetes. High glucose (HG) induces apoptosis of podocytes, inhibits AMPK activation, inactivates tuberin and activates mTOR. HG also increases the levels of Nox4 and Nox1 and NADPH oxidase activity. Inhibition of mTOR by low dose rapamycin decreases HG-induced Nox4 and Nox1, NADPH oxidase activity and podocyte apoptosis. Inhibition of mTOR had no effect on AMPK or tuberin phosphorylation indicating that mTOR is downstream of these signaling molecules. In isolated glomeruli of OVE26 mice, there is similar decrease in the activation of AMPK and tuberin and activation of mTOR with increase in Nox4 and NADPH oxidase activity. Inhibition of mTOR by small dose of rapamycin reduces podocyte apoptosis, attenuates glomerular injury and albuminuria. Our data provide evidence for a novel function of mTOR in Nox4-derived ROS generation and podocyte apoptosis that contributes to urinary albumin excretion in type 1 diabetes. Thus mTOR and or NADPH oxidase inhibition may represent a therapeutic modality of diabetic kidney disease.",

In vitro studies have determined that in addition to its specific methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) MeCP2 also has several chromatin association domains. However, the specific interactions of MeCP2 with methylated or non-methylated chromatin regions and the structural characteristics of the resulting DNA associations in vivo remain poorly understood. We analysed the role of the MBD in MeCP2-chromatin associations in vivo using an MeCP2 mutant Rett syndrome mouse model (Mecp2(tm)(1)(.)(1)(Jae)) in which exon 3 deletion results in an N-terminal truncation of the protein, including most of the MBD. Our results show that in mutant mice, the truncated form of MeCP2 (\u0394MeCP2) is expressed in different regions of the brain and liver, albeit at 50% of its wild-type (wt) counterpart. In contrast to the punctate nuclear distribution characteristic of wt MeCP2, \u0394MeCP2 exhibits both diffuse nuclear localization and a substantial retention in the cytoplasm, suggesting a dysfunction of nuclear transport. In mutant brain tissue, neuronal nuclei are smaller, and \u0394MeCP2 chromatin is digested faster by nucleases, producing a characteristic nuclease-resistant dinucleosome. Although a fraction of \u0394MeCP2 is found associated with nucleosomes, its interaction with chromatin is transient and weak. Thus, our results unequivocally demonstrate that in vivo the MBD of MeCP2 together with its adjacent region in the N-terminal domain are critical for the proper interaction of the protein with chromatin, which cannot be replaced by any other of its protein domains.",

However, more recently the direct effect of LRP5 on osteoblasts and bone formation has been questioned. Gene expression studies showed that mice lacking lrp5 have increased expression of tph1, the rate limiting enzyme for the production of serotonin in the gut. Furthermore mice lacking either tph1 or htr1B, the receptor for serotonin on the osteoblasts, were reported to have an increased bone mass due to increased bone formation. This led to the still controversial hypothesis that LRP5 influences bone formation indirectly by regulating the expression of thp1 and as a consequence influencing the production of serotonin in the gut. Based on these data we decided to evaluate the role of TPH1 and HTR1B in the development of craniotubular hyperostoses, a group of monogenic sclerosing bone dysplasias. We screened the coding regions of both genes in 53 patients lacking a mutation in the known causative genes LRP5, LRP4 and SOST. We could not find disease-causing coding variants in neither of the tested genes and therefore, we cannot provide support for an important function of TPH1 and HTR1B in the pathogenesis of sclerosing bone dysplasias in our tested patient cohort.",

Currently, the available therapies for the treatment of metastatic melanoma are of limited benefit. Thus, the functional analysis of conventional therapies may help to improve their efficiency in the treatment of metastatic melanoma. In the present study, the exposure of melanoma cells to vinblastine was found to trigger apoptosis as evidenced by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, the release of both cytochrome c and apoptosis inducing factor, activation of caspase-9 and 3, and cleavage of Poly (ADP-ribose)-Polymerase. Also, vinblastine enhances the phosphorylation of Ras homologous protein A, the accumulation of reactive oxygen species, the release of intracellular Ca(2+), as well as the activation of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1, c-jun-N-terminal kinase, p38, inhibitor of kappaB\u03b1 (I\u03baB\u03b1) kinase, and inositol requiring enzyme 1\u03b1. In addition, vinblastine induces the DNA-binding activities of the transcription factor NF-\u03baB, HSF1, AP-1, and ATF-2, together with the expression of HSP70 and Bax proteins. Moreover, inhibitory experiments addressed a central role for Rho A in the regulation of vinblastine-induced apoptosis of melanoma cells via mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial-dependent mechanisms.

We exemplify this with SGLT2 inhibition modeling (by changing the renal threshold parameters) using published data of renal effect, showing that the modeled effect is concordant with the effects on fasting glucose from independent data.RESULTSiHOMA2 modeling of thiazolidinediones effect suggested that changes in insulin sensitivity in the fasting state are predominantly hepatic. SGLT2 inhibition modeled by iHOMA2 resulted in a decrease in mean glucose of 1.1 mmol/L. Observed data showed a decrease in glucose of 0.9 mmol/L. There was no significant difference between the model and the independent data. Manipulation of iHOMA2s renal excretion threshold variable suggested that a decrease of 17% was required to obtain a 0.9 mmol/L decrease in mean glucose.CONCLUSIONSiHOMA2 is an extended mathematical model for the assessment of insulin resistance and \u03b2-cell function.

This study explored a crucial link between oxidative stress and pulmonary fibrogenesis, focusing on nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a core transcription factor in antioxidative regulation systems. Treatment of C57 BL/6 mice with bleomycin increased fibroblast viability and collagen production and significantly downregulated Nrf2. In addition, prominent oxidative stress was indicated by changes in superoxide dismutase, catalase activity, and glutathione and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance levels. In a cell-based model, bleomycin suppressed Nrf2 activation via extracellular signal-related kinase phosphorylation, enhancing intracellular reactive oxygen species in lung fibroblasts and stimulating abnormal cell proliferation and collagen secretion. To confirm this novel mechanism of bleomycin-induced fibrogenesis, we attempted to upregulate Nrf2 and related antioxidant proteins in bleomycin-treated fibroblasts using a putative Nrf2 activator, caffeic acid phenethyl ester, and the results showed that bleomycin-induced fibroblast proliferation and collagen content were attenuated through improved redox balance.

        "input": "Membrane traffic requires the specific concentration of protein cargos and exclusion of other proteins into nascent carriers. Critical components of this selectivity are the protein adaptors that bind to short, linear motifs in the cytoplasmic tails of transmembrane protein cargos and sequester them into nascent carriers. The recruitment of the adaptors is mediated by activated Arf GTPases and the Arf-adaptor complexes mark sites of carrier formation. However, the nature of the signal(s) that initiate carrier biogenesis remains unknown. We examined the specificity and initial sites of recruitment of Arf-dependent adaptors (AP-1 and GGAs) in response to the Golgi or endosomal localization of specific cargo proteins (furin, mannose-6-phosphate receptor (M6PR) and M6PR lacking a C-terminal domain M6PR\u0394C). We find that cargo promotes the recruitment of specific adaptors, suggesting that it is part of an upstream signaling event. Cargos do not promote adaptor recruitment to all compartments in which they reside and thus additional factors regulate the cargo's ability to promote Arf activation and adaptor recruitment. We document that within a given compartment different cargos recruit different adaptors suggesting that there is little or no free, activated Arf at the membrane and that Arf activation is spatially and temporally coupled to the cargo and the adaptor. Using temperature block, Brefeldin A, and recovery from each, we found that the cytoplasmic tail of M6PR causes the recruitment of AP-1 and GGAs to recycling endosomes and not at the Golgi, as predicted by steady state staining profiles.

Doxorubicin is mainly excreted into the bile via P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (Mrp2) in hepatobiliary route and metabolized via cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A subfamily. Also the hepatic Mrp2 (not P-gp) and CYP3A subfamily levels were reduced in EE-induced cholestatic (EEC) rats. Thus, we herein report the pharmacokinetic changes of doxorubicin with respect to the changes in its biliary excretion and hepatic metabolism in EEC rats. 2. The pharmacokinetic study of doxorubicin after intravenous administration of its hydrochloride was conducted along with the investigation of bile flow rate and hepatobiliary excretion of doxorubicin in control and EEC rats. 3. The significantly greater AUC (58.7% increase) of doxorubicin in EEC rats was due to the slower CL (32.9% decrease). The slower CL was due to the reduction of hepatic biliary excretion (67.0% decrease) and hepatic CYP3A subfamily-mediated metabolism (21.9% decrease) of doxorubicin.

Here we studied the effects of the recently developed monoacylglycerol lipase inhibitor JZL184 on basal and stress-induced corticosterone levels in male CD1 mice, and found that this compound dramatically increased basal levels without affecting stress responses. Since acute changes in corticosterone levels can affect behavior, JZL184 was administered concurrently with the corticosterone synthesis inhibitor metyrapone, to investigate whether the previously shown behavioral effects of JZL184 are dependent on corticosterone. We found that in the elevated plus-maze, the effects of JZL184 on \"classical\" anxiety-related measures were abolished by corticosterone synthesis blockade. By contrast, effects on the \"ethological\" measures of anxiety (i.e. risk assessment) were not affected by metyrapone. In the open-field, the locomotion-enhancing effects of the compound were not changed either. These findings show that monoacylglycerol lipase inhibition dramatically increases basal levels of corticosterone.

After each period, subjects received a 6-h meal tolerance test (MTT) with [(14)C]glucose to calculate glucose kinetics. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting plasma insulin, C-peptide (insulin secretory rate [ISR]), fasting plasma glucagon, and bioactive glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) and gastrointestinal insulinotropic peptide (GIP) was measured.RESULTSFPG decreased from P, 160 \u00b1 4 to M, 150 \u00b1 4; S, 154 \u00b1 4; and M+S, 125 \u00b1 3 mg/dL.

The increase in mean post-MTT plasma insulin and in ISR was similar in P, M, and S and slightly greater in M+S. Fasting plasma glucagon was equal (\u223c65-75 pg/mL) with all treatments, but there was a significant drop during the initial 120 min with S 24% and M+S 34% (both P < 0.05) vs. P 17% and M 16%. Fasting and mean post-MTT plasma bioactive GLP-1 were higher (P < 0.01) after S and M+S vs. M and P.

We aimed to address the hypothesis that platelets contribute to aberrant COX-2 expression in HT29 colon carcinoma cells and to reveal the role of platelet-induced COX-2 on the expression of proteins involved in malignancy and marker genes of epithelial-mesenchymal transition(EMT). Human platelets co-cultured with HT29 cells rapidly adhered to cancer cells and induced COX-2 mRNA expression, but not protein synthesis which required the late release of platelet PDGF and COX-2 mRNA stabilization. Platelet-induced COX-2-dependent PGE2 synthesis in HT29 cells was involved in downregulation of p21(WAF1/CIP1) and upregulation of cyclinB1, since these effects were prevented by rofecoxib(a selective COX-2 inhibitor) and rescued by exogenous PGE2. Galectin-3, highly expressed in HT29 cells, is unique among galectins because it contains a collagen-like domain. Thus, we studied the role of galectin-3 and platelet collagen receptors in platelet-induced COX-2 overexpression. Inhibitors of galectin-3 function(\u03b2-lactose, a dominant-negative form of galectin-3,Gal-3C, and anti-galectin-3 antibody M3/38) or collagen receptor-mediated platelet adhesion(revacept, a dimeric collagen receptor GPVI-Fc) prevented aberrant COX-2 expression. Inhibition of platelet-cancer cell interaction by revacept was more effective than rofecoxib in preventing platelet-induced mRNA changes of EMT markers suggesting that direct cell-cell contact and aberrant COX-2 expression synergistically induced gene expression modifications associated with EMT. In conclusion, our findings provide the rationale for testing blockers of collagen binding sites, such as revacept, and galectin-3 inhibitors in the prevention of colon cancer metastasis in animal models followed by studies in patients.",

In fact, we demonstrated a significant stimulation of Nox4 activity by 4 quinone derivatives (AA-861, tBuBHQ, tBuBQ, and duroquinone) observed in 3 different cellular models, HEK293E, T-REx\u2122, and chondrocyte cell lines. Our results indicate that the effect is specific toward Nox4 versus Nox2. Furthermore, we showed that NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) may participate in this stimulation. Interestingly, Nox4 activity is also stimulated by reducing agents that possibly act by reducing the disulfide bridge (Cys226, Cys270) located in the extracellular E-loop of Nox4. Such model of Nox4 activity regulation could provide new insight into the understanding of the molecular mechanism of the electron transfer through the enzyme, i.e., its potential redox regulation, and could also define new therapeutic targets in diseases in which quinones and Nox4 are implicated.",

Fresh and heated raw garlic extracts (FRGE and HRGE) were prepared with incubation at 25\u00b0C and 95\u00b0C, respectively, for 2h. Treatment with FRGE and HRGE significantly reduced the LPS-induced increase in the pro-inflammatory cytokine concentration (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6) and NO through HO-1 upregulation in RAW 264.7 macrophages. The anti-inflammatory effect was greater in FRGE than in HRGE. The allicin concentration was higher in FRGE than in HRGE. Allicin treatment showed reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and NO and increased HO-1 activity. The results show that the decrease in LPS-induced NO and pro-inflammatory cytokines in RAW 264.7 macrophages through HO-1 induction was greater for FRGE compared with HRGE. Additionally, the results indicate that allicin is responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect of FRGE.

However, the adverse effects of TCDD on the central nervous system (CNS) have not been entirely elucidated. In this study, using reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and ELISA, we showed that TCDD up-regulated the expression and secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) in a time-dependent manner in cultured HAPI microglial cells. TCDD also caused a fast (within 30min as judged by the increase in its mRNA level) activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2). This initial action was accompanied by up-regulation of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), an important inflammation marker within 1h after TCDD treatment. These pro-inflammatory responses were inhibited by two types of Ca(2+) blockers, bis-(o-aminophenoxy) ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetra-acetic acid acetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA-AM) and nifedipine, thus, indicating that the effects are triggered by initial increase in the intracellular concentration of free Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)]i). Further, TCDD exposure could induce phosphorylation- and ubiquitination-dependent degradation of I\u043aB\u03b1, and the translocation of NF-\u03baB p65 from the cytosol to the nucleus in this microglial cell line. Thus, the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway can be activated after TCDD treatment. However, Ca(2+) blockers also obviously attenuated NF-\u03baB activation and transnuclear transport induced by TCDD. In concert with these results, we highlighted that the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokine and NF-\u03baB activation induced by TCDD can be mediated by elevation of [Ca(2+)]i in HAPI microglial cells.",

In contrast, synaptic inhibition and its modulation by neurosteroids were preserved in these neurons. The time course of NMDA effects on surface and total \u03b4 subunit expression were distinct; shorter (6 hrs) treatment decreased surface expression, whereas longer treatment reduced both surface and total expression. APV blocked NMDA effects on \u03b4 subunit expression. Chelation of calcium ions by BAPTA-AM or blockade of ERK1/2 activation by UO126 also prevented the NMDA effects.

LTs are inflammatory mediators playing a pathophysiological role in different diseases like asthma, allergic rhinitis as well as cardiovascular diseases and certain types of cancer. With the rising number of indications for anti-LT therapy, 5-LO inhibitor drug development becomes increasingly important. Areas covered: Here, both recent findings regarding the pathophysiological role of 5-LO and the patents claimed for 5-LO inhibitors are discussed. Focusing on direct inhibitors, several patents disclosing FLAP antagonists are also subject of this review. Novel compounds include 1,5-diarylpyrazoles, indolizines and indoles and several natural product extracts. Expert opinion: Evaluation of the patent activities revealed only quite moderate action. Nevertheless, several auspicious drug-like molecules were disclosed. It seems that in the near future, FLAP inhibitors can be expected to enter the market for the treatment of asthma. With the resolved structure of 5-LO, structure-based drug design is now applicable. Together with the identification of downstream enzyme inhibitors and dual-targeting drugs within the AA cascade, several tools are at hand to cope with 5-LOs increasing pathophysiological roles.",

The present study investigated the role of calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase CASK in interacting and controlling P2X3 receptor expression and function in mouse trigeminal ganglia. Most ganglion neurons in situ or in culture co-expressed P2X3 and CASK. CASK was immunoprecipitated with P2X3 receptors from trigeminal ganglia and from P2X3/CASK-cotransfected HEK cells. Recombinant P2X3/CASK expression in HEK cells increased serine phosphorylation of P2X3 receptors, typically associated with receptor upregulation. CASK deletion mutants also enhanced P2X3 subunit expression. After silencing CASK, cell surface P2X3 receptor expression was decreased, which is consistent with depressed P2X3 currents. The reduction of P2X3 expression levels was reversed by the proteasomal inhibitor MG-132. Moreover, neuronal CASK/P2X3 interaction was upregulated by NGF signaling and downregulated by P2X3 agonist-induced desensitization. These data suggest a novel interaction between CASK and P2X3 receptors with positive outcome for receptor stability and function. As CASK-mediated control of P2X3 receptors was dependent on the receptor activation state, CASK represents an intracellular gateway to regulate purinergic nociceptive signaling.

Mutations render trypsinogen resistant to CTRC-mediated degradation and/or increase processing of the activation peptide by CTRC. Here we demonstrate that activation peptide mutations D19A, D22G, K23R and K23_I24insIDK robustly increased the rate of trypsinogen autoactivation, both in the presence and absence of CTRC. Degradation of the mutants by CTRC was unchanged and processing of the activation peptide was increased only in the D19A mutant by 4-fold. Surprisingly, however, this increased processing had only a minimal effect on autoactivation. The tetra-aspartate motif in the trypsinogen activation peptide binds calcium (KD ~1.6 mM), which stimulates autoactivation. Unexpectedly, calcium binding was not compromised by any of the activation peptide mutations. Despite normal binding, autoactivation of mutants D22G and K23_I24insIDK was not stimulated by calcium. Finally, the activation peptide mutants exhibited reduced secretion from transfected cells, and secreted trypsinogen levels were inversely proportional with autoactivation rates. We conclude that D19A, D22G, K23R and K23_I24insIDK form a mechanistically distinct subset of hereditary pancreatitis associated mutations, which exert their effect primarily through direct stimulation of autoactivation, independently of CTRC. The potentially severe clinical impact of the markedly increased autoactivation is offset by diminished secretion, resulting in a clinical phenotype indistinguishable from typical hereditary pancreatitis.

Pasireotide has a receptor binding profile that is distinct from that of other somatostatin analogues, binding with high affinity to somatostatin receptor subtype 5, which is strongly over expressed in corticotroph adenoma cells. Pasireotide is the first pituitary-directed agent to be approved for use in Cushing's disease. In a phase III clinical trial in patients with Cushing's disease, twice-daily pasireotide 600 or 900\u00a0\u03bcg for 6\u00a0months led to normalization of urinary free cortisol (UFC) levels in up to a quarter of all patients (primary endpoint) and significantly reduced mean UFC levels. The reduction in UFC levels is rapid (within one to two months) and sustained (up to 24\u00a0months). Most patients who do not have an early response to pasireotide do not respond at a later time point. Decreases in UFC levels achieved during pasireotide treatment are accompanied by decreases in serum and salivary cortisol levels, as well as improvements in clinical signs and symptoms, including body weight, blood pressure and health-related quality-of-life. Pasireotide has a generally similar tolerability profile to that of other somatostatin analogues, but is associated with a relatively high incidence of hyperglycaemia, requiring the addition or intensification of glucose-lowering medication in a substantial proportion of patients. Thus, pasireotide, together with on-going patient monitoring, provides a promising new option for the medical management of Cushing's disease.",

A variety of modern in vitro approaches have been used to explore potential underlying mechanisms. Covalent binding studies were undertaken with [(14)C]-fenclozic acid to investigate the possible role of reactive metabolites. Time-dependent covalent binding to protein was observed in NADPH-supplemented liver microsomes, although no metabolites were detected in these incubations or in reactive metabolite trapping experiments. In human hepatocytes, covalent binding was observed at lower levels than in microsomes and a minor uncharacterizable metabolite was also observed. In addition, covalent binding was observed in incubations undertaken with dog and rat hepatocytes, where a taurine conjugate of the drug was detected. Although an acyl glucuronide metabolite was detected when liver microsomes from human, rat and dog were supplemented with UDPGA, there was no detectable UDPGA-dependent covalent binding. No effects were observed when fenclozic acid was assessed for P450-dependent and P450-independent cytotoxicity to THLE cell lines, time-dependent inhibition of five major human cytochrome P450 enzymes, inhibition of the biliary efflux transporters BSEP and MRP2 or mitochondrial toxicity to THLE or HepG2 cells.

Recently, it was reported that S1P inhibits osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption. On the other hand, S1P effects on osteoblasts and bone formation are little known. In this study, we investigated the effects of S1P on osteoblasts, using two osteoblast-like cell lines, SaOS-2 and MC3T3-E1. S1P activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling, leading to the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 and the nuclear translocation of \u03b2-catenin, followed by the increase of the transcriptional activity by \u03b2-catenin/T-cell factor complex formation in both SaOS-2 cells and MC3T3-E1 cells. The inhibitors of PI3K and Akt suppressed S1P-induced nuclear localization of \u03b2-catenin. We further investigated the effects of PI3K/Akt signaling on the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway, since \u03b2-catenin takes a central role in this signaling pathway. Both inhibitors for PI3K and Akt suppressed the nuclear localization of \u03b2-catenin and T-cell factor transcriptional activity induced by Wnt-3a. S1P increased the amount of osteoprotegerin at both mRNA and protein levels, and increased the activity of alkaline phosphatase, leading to the mineralization. These findings suggest that S1P activates the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway leading to the promotion of nuclear translocation of \u03b2-catenin in osteoblast-like cells, resulting in the upregulation of osteoptotegerin and osteoblast differentiation markers including alkaline phosphatase, probably relating to the inhibition of osteoclast formation and the mineralization, respectively.",

This study thus aimed at assessing the hematological effects alteration of pyrethroid insecticide exposure using the experimental animal model. Objective: A commonly available Electric Mosquito-Repellent Liquid pyrethroid insecticide containing prallethrin 1.6% w/w is widely used for mosquito control in Saudi Arabia. The immunotoxic effects after inhalation exposures to the preparation for a continuous period of 24, 48, and 72\u2009h were investigated in rats. Methods and materials: Rats were exposed to prallethrin 1.6% w/w by inhalation for 72 consecutive hours. Total blood count, blood indices of creatine kinase (CK), gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (\u03b3-GT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), nitric oxide (NO), malondialdehyde (MDA), interleukin (IL)-2, tumor necrosis factors (TNF)\u03b1, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19.9 and carcinoembrionic antigen (CEA) were assayed. Results: The administration of prallethrin 1.6% w/w created significant increased changes in the levels of total WBC, lymphocytes, RBC, hemoglobin, packed cell volume, platelets, mean corpuscular volume, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin in rats after 24, 48, and 72\u2009h of continuous inhalation; however, there was a significant reduction in neutrophils at transient reduction in the monocytes after 24 and 48\u2009h to return to normal after 72\u2009h. Significant increases in the levels of CK, \u03b3-GT, SOD, NO, MDA, AFP, IL-2, and TNF\u03b1 were recorded. CA and CEA did not exhibit any change. Conclusions: Continuous inhalation to prallethrin 1.6% insecticides poses toxicity on hematological variables.

To further validate the result, we examined sub-cellular distribution of c-Rel in lungs of CS-exposed guinea pigs treated or untreated with vitamin C.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is one of the major regulators of endothelial cell survival and is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of COPD. Fibroblasts are a significant source of VEGF in the lungs; however the effect of cigarette smoke exposure on VEGF release by fibroblasts is not fully understood. We hypothesized that cigarette smoke-induced disturbed VEGF release by human lung fibroblasts is a potential pathogenic mechanism that could contribute to COPD. Cigarette smoke extract (CSE) was prepared by modification of the methods of Carp and Janoff (American Review of Respiratory Disease, 1978). Human fetal lung fibroblasts (HFL-1) were exposed to different concentrations of CSE and for different durations. VEGF release into the media was measured using ELISA. TGF-\u03b21 receptor (T\u03b2R1)/Smad3 as a potential pathway for CSE modulated VEGF release was also investigated using biochemical analyses and siRNA inhibition of Smad3 and siRNA and pharmacologic inhibition of T\u03b2R1. CSE induced VEGF release by HFL-1 in concentration and time dependent manner. This was confirmed in two additional types of primary human fetal lung fibroblasts. CSE induced Smad3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation in HFL-1 cells. Silencing of Smad3 by siRNA not only eliminated the stimulatory effect of CSE on VEGF release but also inhibited baseline VEGF production. Suppression of T\u03b2R1 by the pharmacological inhibitor (SB431542) markedly reduced VEGF release by HFL-1 in response to CSE and this effect was confirmed by T\u03b2R1 siRNA. In contrast, nicotine inhibited VEGF release by HFL-1 in a dose and time dependent manner. Our findings indicate that CSE stimulates Smad3-mediated VEGF release by lung fibroblasts. Nicotine does not account for the CSE stimulation of VEGF in HFL-1. The ability of lung fibroblasts to produce VEGF may play a role in pathogenesis of cigarette smoke induced lung disease.",

We found that in vitro rapamycin also regulates the proteasome, an essential intracellular protease of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.

Moreover, the drug interferes with binding of the 19S cap essential for processing of polyubiquitinylated substrates, and the PA200 activator to the 20S catalytic core proteasome. These protein complexes are known to bind to specific grooves on the \u03b1 face region of the 20S core. A treatment with rapamycin affects conformational dynamics of the proteasomal gate, a centrally positioned within the \u03b1 face and allosterically regulated element responsible for the intake of substrates. Interestingly, we showed that rapamycin shares all the proteasome targeting properties not only with other two-domain, closed-ring analogs (rapalogs), but also with its single domain mimics, and with seco-rapamycin. The latter is the first in vivo open-ring metabolite of rapamycin that does not affect mTOR.

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Characterization of novel rodent models for prostate cancer studies requires evaluation of either spontaneous and carcinogen-induced tumors as well as tumor incidence in different prostatic lobes. We propose a new short-term rodent model of chemically induced prostate carcinogenesis in which prostate cancer progression occurs differentially in the dorsolateral and ventral lobes. METHODS: Adult gerbils were treated with MNU alone or associated with testosterone for 3 or 6 months of treatment. Tumor incidence, latency, localization, and immunohistochemistry (AR, PCNA, smooth muscle \u03b1-actin, p63, MGMT, and E-cadherin) were studied in both lobes. RESULTS: Comparisons between both lobes revealed that lesions developed first in the DL while the VL presented longer tumor latency. However, after 6 months, there was a dramatic increase in tumor multiplicity in the VL, mainly in MNU-treated groups. Lesions clearly progressed from a premalignant to a malignant phenotype over time and tumor latency was decreased by MNU\u2009+\u2009testosterone administration. Three-dimensional reconstruction of the prostatic complex showed that the DL developed tumors exclusively in the periurethral area and showed intense AR, PCNA, and MGMT immunostaining. Moreover, VL lesions emerged throughout the entire lobe. MNU-induced lesions presented markers indicative of an aggressive phenotype: lack of basal cells, rupture of the smooth muscle cell layer, loss of E-cadherin, and high MGMT staining. CONCLUSIONS: There are distinct pathways involved in tumor progression in gerbil prostate lobes. This animal provides a good model for prostate cancer since it allows the investigation of advanced steps of carcinogenesis with shorter latency periods in both lobes.

Methylphenidate, an inhibitor of dopamine and norepinephrine transporters (DAT and NET, respectively), is a standard treatment for ADHD. The Spontaneously Hypertensive Rat (SHR) is a well-established animal model of ADHD. Our previous results showed that methylphenidate treatment in adolescent SHR enhanced cocaine self-administration during adulthood, and alterations in DAT function in prefrontal cortex play a role in this response. Importantly, prefrontal cortex subregions, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), have been shown to have distinct roles in ADHD and cocaine self-administration. In the current study, SHR, Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and Wistar (WIS) rats received a therapeutically relevant dose of methylphenidate (1.5mg/kg, p.o.) or vehicle during adolescence and then OFC and mPFC DAT function and cellular expression were assessed during adulthood. In both OFC and mPFC, no strain differences in Vmax or Km for dopamine uptake into synaptosomes were found between vehicle-treated SHR, WKY and WIS. Methylphenidate increased DAT Vmax in SHR mPFC and decreased DAT Vmax in WKY OFC. Also, methylphenidate decreased DAT Km in WIS OFC. Further, methylphenidate did not alter DAT cellular localization, indicating that methylphenidate treatment during adolescence regulated DAT function in SHR mPFC in a trafficking-independent manner. Thus, the increase in mPFC DAT function was an SHR-specific long term consequence of methylphenidate treatment during adolescence, which may be responsible for the treatment-induced alterations in behavior including the observed increases in cocaine self-administration.",

This compound can be treated either as a structurally similar one to B[c]Ph, or as a phenanthrene skeleton with an electrodonating alkyl substituent in the bay-region of the molecule. The second thread, providing available data on the adverse effects of CP[c]Ph compounds on cells and tissues of living organisms, mainly fish, improves our understanding of these possible environmental hazards. The data show that CP[c]Ph is less potent at inducing CYP1A gene expression in rainbow trout than benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), a well-known Ah-receptor agonist. Interestingly, the CP[c]Ph dependent up-regulation of CYP1A mRNA is positively correlated with the incidences of clastogenic changes in rainbow trout erythrocytes. CP[c]Ph has, comparably to B[a]P, a potential to repress expression of tumor suppressor p53, in the head kidney of rainbow trout. Furthermore, estrogen responsive genes in fish liver, ER\u03b1 and VTG, are not induced by CP[c]Ph, suggesting that the compound has no endocrine disrupting potential. However, some CP[c]Phs show mutagenic activity when investigated in the Ames test, and exhibit genotoxic properties in in vitro micronucleus assay. The above characteristics suggest that CP-PAHs are chemicals of concern for which potential pathways of exposure should be further identified.",

        "input": "The extra-pyramidal symptoms associated with manganism often overlap with that seen in Parkinsonism suggesting a common link between the two disorders. Since wide deviations are observed in susceptibility and characteristics of the symptoms observed in manganism, these differences may be due to underlying genetic variability. Genes linked to early onset of Parkinsonism which includes ATP13A2 and parkin have already been suggested to promote development of Mn toxicity. Of the other Parkinson-linked genes, mutations in LRRK2, an autosomal dominant gene, represent another likely candidate involved in the development of manganism. In this paper the effect of shRNA LRRK2 knock-down on Mn toxicity was examined in control and DAT transfected HEK293 cells. Results demonstrate that LRRK2 down-regulation potentiates Mn toxicity in both control and DAT-transfected cell as well as potentiates DA toxicity. Combined treatment of Mn and DA further augments cell toxicity, ROS production and JNK phosphorylation in LRRK2 deficient cells compared to controls. Consistent with studies demonstrating that LRRK2 plays a role in the phosphorylation of p38, our results similarly demonstrate a decrease in p38 activation in LRRK2 knock-down cells. Our findings suggest that null mutations in LRRK2 which cause Parkinsonism potentiate Mn toxicity and increase susceptibility to develop manganism.",

In this study, domestic chicken eggs were injected with TCPP or TDCPP (maximum dose = 51600 and 45000 ng/g egg, respectively) to determine dose-dependent effects on pipping success, development, hepatic messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels of genes associated with xenobiotic metabolism and the thyroid hormone (TH) pathway, and TH levels following 20-22 days of incubation. Neither compound reduced pipping success; however, TCPP significantly delayed pipping at 9240 and 51600 ng/g and reduced tarsus length at 51600 ng/g. TDCPP exposure resulted in significant decreases in head plus bill length, embryo mass and gallbladder size at 45000 ng/g and reduced plasma free T4 levels at 7640 ng/g. Type I deiodinase, liver fatty-acid binding protein and cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A37 mRNA levels were significantly induced by TCPP, while TDCPP induced CYP3A37 and CYP2H1. Chemical analysis of egg contents at incubation days 0, 5, 11, 18, and 19 revealed that >92% of the injected TCPP or TDCPP concentration was detectable up to day 5; however, <1% was detected by day 19. The observed phenotypic responses to TCPP and TDCPP exposure may be associated with disruption of the TH-axis, which is critical for normal growth and development in birds. The effects of TDCPP on the gallbladder indicate that the disturbance of lipid metabolism is a likely target in its mechanism of toxicity.",

        "input": "Abstract This study aimed to investigate the role of Salvia triloba L. and Piper nigrum extracts in ameliorating neuroinflammatory insults characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in an experimentally induced rat model. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were classified into Group 1 (n=10): normal healthy animals serving as the negative control group; Group 2 (n=60): the AD-induced group. After AD induction, animals in the AD-induced group were divided randomly and equally into 6 subgroups. The first subgroup served as AD control; the second one, which served as positive control, was treated orally with the conventional therapy for AD (rivastigmine) at a dose of 0.3\u2009mg/kg body weight (b.w.) daily for 3 months. The third and fourth subgroups were, respectively, treated orally with the S. triloba extract at a dose of 750 and 375\u2009mg/kg b.w. daily for 3 months. The fifth and sixth subgroups were, respectively, treated orally with the P. nigrum extract at a dose of 187.5 and 93.75\u2009mg/kg b.w. daily for 3 months. Levels of brain acetylcholine (Ach), serum and brain acetylcholinesterase (AchE) activity, C-reactive protein (CRP), total nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-\u03baB), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) were estimated. The results showed that administration of AlCl3 resulted in a significant elevation in the levels of AchE activity, CRP, NF-\u03baB, and MCP-1 accompanied with a significant depletion in the Ach level. Treatment of AD rats with each of the selected medicinal plant extracts caused marked improvement in the measured biochemical parameters. In conclusion, S. triloba and P. nigrum methanolic extracts have potent anti-inflammatory effects against neuroinflammation characterizing AD.",

        "input": "Serotonin transporters (SERT) play an essential role in the termination and regulation of serotonin signaling in the brain. SERT is also the target of antidepressants and psychostimulants. Molecules with novel activities and modes of interaction with regard to SERT function are of great scientific and clinical interest. We explored structural regions outside the putative serotonin translocation pathway to identify potential binding sites for allosteric transporter modulators (ATMs). Mutational studies revealed a pocket of amino acids outside the orthosteric substrate binding sites located in the interface between extracellular loops 1 and 3 that when mutated affect transporter function. Using the structure of the bacterial transporter homologue leucine transporter as a template, we developed a structural model of SERT. We performed molecular dynamics simulations to further characterize the allosteric pocket that was identified by site-directed mutagenesis studies and employed this pocket in a virtual screen for small-molecule modulators of SERT function. In functional transport assays, we found that one of the identified molecules, ATM7, increased the reuptake of serotonin, possibly by facilitating the interaction of serotonin with transport-ready conformations of SERT when concentrations of serotonin were low and rate limiting. In addition, ATM7 potentiates 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine (MDMA, \"Ecstasy\")-induced reversed transport by SERT. Taking advantage of a conformationally sensitive residue in transmembrane domain 6, we demonstrate that ATM7 mechanistically stabilizes an outward-facing conformation of SERT. Taken together these observations demonstrate that ATM7 acts through a novel mechanism that involves allosteric modulation of SERT function.",

        "input": "Several investigations have shown a relation between diabetes and alterations of the liver circadian clock. We investigated the diurnal expression of clock genes and clock-controlled genes (CCGs) in 3-hour intervals for a 24-h period in the livers of male streptozotocin (STZ)-treated rats, male spontaneous type 1 diabetic LEW.1AR1-iddm (Iddm) rats, and Iddm rats treated for 10 days with insulin. Hepatic mRNA was extracted, and the relative expression of clock genes (Per1, Per2, Bmal1, Clock, Cry1), as well as CCGs (Dbp, E4bp4, RevErb\u03b1, Ror\u03b1, Ppar\u03b3), was analyzed by reverse transcription followed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Diabetic STZ and Iddm rats, as well as insulin-substituted Iddm rats, exhibited a significant diurnal expression pattern of clock genes as determined by Cosinor analysis; however, the MESOR (midline estimating statistic of rhythm) of Bmal1, Per2, and Clock transcript expression was altered in Iddm and insulin-substituted Iddm rats. The hepatic expression of the CCGs Dbp and RevErb\u03b1 revealed a diurnal rhythm in all investigated groups. Insulin administration to Iddm rats normalized the enhanced MESOR in the expression of Dbp, RevErb\u03b1, and E4bp4 to the levels of normoglycemic controls. Cosinor analysis indicated no diurnal rhythm of Ppar\u03b3 expression in the livers of diabetic STZ or Iddm rats or in those of insulin-substituted Iddm rats. Also, insulin substitution could not reverse the decreased MESOR of Ppar\u03b3 expression in Iddm rats. In consequence of the diabetic disease, changes in the expression of clock genes and CCGs suggest alterations in the hepatic peripheral clock mechanism.",

        "input": "RATIONALE: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), in addition to being able to enhance serotonergic neurotransmission, are able to modulate other brain systems involved in depression. OBJECTIVES: This study evaluates the neurochemical effect of the SSRI citalopram on brain noradrenergic activity and the serotonin receptor involved in this effect. METHODS: Dual-probe microdialysis in the locus coeruleus (LC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) was performed in freely awake rats. RESULTS: Systemic citalopram (10\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.) increased noradrenaline (NA) in the LC (E max\u2009=\u2009141\u2009\u00b1\u200913\u00a0%) and simultaneously decreased NA in the PFC (Emax\u2009=\u2009-46\u2009\u00b1\u20097\u00a0%). In the local presence into the LC of the \u03b12-adrenoceptor antagonist RS79948 (1\u00a0\u03bcM), systemic citalopram increased NA in the LC (Emax\u2009=\u2009157\u2009\u00b1\u200925\u00a0%) and PFC (Emax\u2009=\u2009175\u2009\u00b1\u200924\u00a0%). Local citalopram (0.1-100\u00a0\u03bcM) into the LC induced NA increase in the LC (Emax\u2009=\u2009210\u2009\u00b1\u200925\u00a0%) and decrease in the PFC (Emax\u2009=\u2009-38\u2009\u00b1\u20099\u00a0%). Local LC citalopram effect was abolished by LC presence of the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist MDL72222 (1\u00a0\u03bcM) but not the 5-HT1/2 receptor antagonist methiothepin (1\u00a0\u03bcM). Systemic citalopram in the LC presence of MDL72222 did not modify NA in the LC but increased NA in the PFC (Emax\u2009=\u2009158\u2009\u00b1\u200926\u00a0%). Local citalopram into the PFC enhanced NA (Emax\u2009=\u2009376\u2009\u00b1\u200918\u00a0%) in the area, which was prevented by MDL72222. CONCLUSIONS: The SSRI citalopram modulates central noradrenergic neurotransmission by activation, through endogenous serotonin, of 5-HT3 receptors expressed in the somatodendritic (LC) and terminal (PFC) areas, which subsequently promote an enhancement of local NA. Therefore, 5-HT3 receptors and somatodendritic \u03b12-adrenoceptors in the LC play an important role in the global effect of SSRIs.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the estrogenic properties and neuroprotective effects of Cyperi Rhizoma under estrogen-deprived condition in female mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To determine the estrogen-like effect of Cyperi Rhizoma extract (CRE), we measured luciferase expression after transfection of a promoter construct containing an estrogen response element (ERE) and treatment of CRE. To evaluate the neuroprotective effect of CRE, we measured striatal dopamine, movement ability, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity, and apoptosis-related protein expression levels after treatment of CRE either with or without 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) in ovariectomized female mice. RESULTS: CRE significantly induced the luciferase expression driven by an ERE in PC12 cells, a dopaminergic cell line, in a dose-dependent manner. In mice, MPTP significantly decreased the levels of dopamine in the striatum and behavior performance; in contrast, both CRE and 17\u03b2-estradiol benzoate (EB) recovered these parameters to normal levels. CRE and EB treatment also recovered TH immunopositive fibers and cells, respectively, from MPTP toxicity. Additionally, MPTP significantly down-regulated Bcl-2 expression in the mitochondria of dopaminergic cells in the SN, followed by an increase in Bax expression, cytochrome C translocation to the cytosol, andcleaved-caspase-3 expression, whereas these were inhibited by CRE or EB treatment.

Water uptake of the polymer was only 2.8 and 0.2% for PEC with the MW of 200 kDa (PEC200) and PEC with the MW of 41 kDa (PEC41), respectively. Degradation of less hydrophilic PEC41 with higher density was slower than that of PEC200. By this mechanism, CE-responsive drug in vitro release from PEC in situ forming depots (ISFD) was conducted successfully. As expected, less bovine serum albumin (BSA) was released from PEC41 compared with that of PEC200 in the same time period.

Thus, the current study was designed to elucidate the molecular mechanism of apoptosis induced by juglone in androgen-sensitive prostate cancer LNCaP cells. MTT assay was performed to examine the anti-proliferative effect of juglone. Occurrence of apoptosis was detected by Hoechst 33342 staining and flow cytometry in LNCaP cells treated with juglone for 24h. The result shown that juglone inhibited the growth of LNCaP cells in a dose-dependent manner. Morphological changes of apoptotic body formation after juglone treatment were observed by Hoechst 33342 staining. This apoptotic induction was associated with loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and caspase-3, -9 activation. Moreover, we found that juglone significantly inhibited the expression levels of androgen receptor (AR) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in a dose-dependent manner, as well as abrogated up-regulation of AR and PSA genes with and/or without dihydrotestosterone (DHT).

ClpP inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis in SK-N-SH cells. Treatment with ClpP resulted in hypodiploid DNA contents, increased Bax/ Bcl-2 ratio and induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production.

Coincidently, caspase-3 and -8 activation and cleavage of PARP were not detected. Moreover, caspase independent apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) was released from mitochondria and translocated to the nucleus in response to ClpP. We also found that ClpP treatment resulted in the increase of p53 activity and cytoplasmic p53 levels were increased by ClpP, suggesting that functional activation of p53 is intact despite increased cytoplasmic accumulation.

The differential expressions of lncRNA and protein coding genes had distinguishable hierarchical clustering expression profiling pattern. Among these differentially expressed lncRNAs, the greatest change was noted for uc002mbe.2, which had more than 300 folds induction upon TSA treatment.

Compared with normal human hepatocytes and adjacent noncancerous tissues, uc002mbe.2 expression level was significantly lower in the HCC cell lines and liver cancer tissues. The TSA-induced uc002mbe.2 expression was positively correlated with the apoptotic effect of TSA in HCC cells. In addition, knockdown the expression of uc002mbe.2 significantly reduced TSA-induced apoptosis of Huh7cells.

In a cytotoxicity assay, steroidal glycosides (1) and (3) had IC50 values of 8.2 and 8.7\u00b5M, but the natural acetylation of the C-6\u2033' hydroxy of the terminal glucose unit in (2) resulted in a 3-fold decrease in cell cytotoxicity when compared with (1). Results from the dermal fibroblast migration assay revealed that the steroidal glycoalkaloids (1) and (2), and the furostanol saponin (3) promoted fibroblast migration from the range of 23.7\u00b15.7 to 37.7\u00b15.1%, as compared with the control. CONCLUSION: Collectively, our data demonstrate that the steroidal glycosides present in Easter lily bulbs induce, at least in part, the observed dermal fibroblast migration activity of the bulb extracts. This is the first evidence that steroidal glycosides from L. longiflorum may potentially play a role in the wound healing process and may provide a scientific basis for the historical use of lily bulbs for this purpose.",

        "input": "Brexpiprazole, a compound sharing structural molecular characteristics with aripiprazole, is currently under investigation for the treatment of schizophrenia and depression. Using electrophysiologic techniques, the present study assessed the in vivo action of brexpiprazole on serotonin (5-HT) receptor subtypes 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, and 5-HT2A; dopamine (DA) D2 autoreceptors, and alpha1- and alpha2-adrenergic receptors. In addition, the effects on 5-HT1A autoreceptors in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and D2 autoreceptors in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) were compared with those of aripiprazole, an agent in wide clinical use. In the DRN, brexpiprazole completely inhibited the firing of 5-HT neurons via 5-HT1A agonism and was more potent than aripiprazole (ED50 = 230 and 700 mug/kg, respectively). In the locus coeruleus, brexpiprazole reversed the inhibitory effect of the preferential 5-HT2A receptor agonist DOI (2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine) on norepinephrine neuronal firing (ED50 = 110 mug/kg), demonstrating 5-HT2A antagonistic action. Brexpiprazole reversed the inhibitory effect of the DA agonist apomorphine on VTA DA neurons (ED50 = 61 mug/kg), whereas it was ineffective when administered alone, indicating partial agonistic action on D2 receptors. Compared with aripiprazole, which significantly inhibited the firing activity of VTA DA neurons, brexpiprazole displayed less efficacy at D2 receptors. In the hippocampus, brexpiprazole acted as a full agonist at 5-HT1A receptors on pyramidal neurons. Furthermore, it increased 5-HT release by terminal alpha2-adrenergic heteroceptor but not 5-HT1B autoreceptor antagonism. In the lateral geniculate nucleus, brexpiprazole displayed alpha1B-adrenoceptor antagonistic action. Taken together, these results provide insight into the in vivo action of brexpiprazole on monoamine targets relevant in the treatment of depression and schizophrenia.",

Terfenadine and astemizole are chemically unrelated to histamine H1-receptor antagonists such as diphenhydramine and chlorpheniramine. Loratadine is structurally related to the antihistamine azatadine, and acrivastine is a side-chain-reduced metabolite of the antihistamine triprolidine. Like other histamine H1-receptor antagonists, they competitively block histamine receptor sites rather than inhibiting histamine release. All four drugs have relatively long half-lives and are rapidly absorbed after oral administration. Terfenadine, astemizole, and loratadine are metabolized extensively in the liver; terfenadine and astemizole are both 97% protein bound. Terfenadine 60 mg twice daily has been shown to be as effective as conventional antihistamines for the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis. In clinical trials, astemizole 10 mg daily was comparable to or better than chlorpheniramine for treatment of chronic rhinitis. Both terfenadine and astemizole were effective for treatment of chronic urticaria. For treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis, loratadine combined with pseudoephedrine may be preferable to triprolidine-pseudoephedrine and acrivastine-pseudoephedrine combinations that require more frequent dosing. Acrivastine must be administered more frequently than the other nonsedating antihistamines. None of these four agents impairs psychomotor activity. Infrequently reported adverse effects include dry mouth, skin reactions, and weight gain. The absence of substantial sedative effects and the less-frequent dosing schedules make these agents good alternatives to the classic antihistamines for treatment of seasonal and chronic rhinitis and chronic urticaria.",

        "input": "We have examined the effects on the activities of three calmodulin-dependent enzymes (cAMP phosphodiesterase, caldesmon kinase and myosin light chain kinase) of the dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel blocker felodipine and three analogues (p-chloro, oxidized and t-butyl) exhibiting different pharmacological potencies. The cAMP phosphodiesterase was inhibited completely by felodipine and the p-chloro analogue with IC50 values of 3.7 and 1.5 microM respectively. The oxidized and t-butyl analogues were relatively ineffective in inhibiting cAMP phosphodiesterase. Felodipine and the p-chloro analogue inhibited the basal (Ca2+/calmodulin-independent) activity of cAMP phosphodiesterase as well as the calmodulin-stimulated activity. Calmodulin was relatively ineffective in preventing inhibition of cAMP phosphodiesterase by felodipine and the p-chloro analogue. These observations suggest that felodipine may act directly on the phosphodiesterase as well as through calmodulin. Felodipine and the p-chloro analogue inhibited Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent caldesmon kinase with similar potencies (IC50 = 17.4 microM), whereas the oxidized and t-butyl analogues caused no inhibition. Similarly, felodipine and the p-chloro analogue inhibited myosin light chain kinase activity whether the isolated 20 kD light chain (IC50 = 12.6 microM) or intact myosin (IC50 = 11.0 microM) was used as substrate. Inhibition in each case was prevented by excess calmodulin. The oxidized and t-butyl derivatives caused little or no inhibition. Finally, the effects of felodipine and the three analogues on two processes which are dependent on myosin phosphorylation were examined, namely the actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity of myosin and the assembly of myosin filaments. Felodipine and the p-chloro analogue inhibited the actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity of smooth muscle myosin (IC50 = 25.1 microM). The oxidized and t-butyl analogues exhibited no inhibition. Similarly, felodipine and the p-chloro analogue blocked myosin filament assembly induced by low concentrations of calmodulin, whereas the oxidized and t-butyl analogues did not. Again, inhibition of the actin-activated myosin Mg2+-ATPase and myosin filament assembly by felodipine and the p-chloro analogue could be reversed by raising the calmodulin concentration. These observations suggest that some of the pharmacological actions of felodipine on smooth muscle may involve inhibition of calmodulin-dependent enzymes which are functionally involved in the regulation of smooth muscle contraction.",

In this work, the interactions between loperamide and two ACTH secretagogues, lysine vasopressin (LVP) and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), were investigated in patients with Addison's disease. After loperamide (16 mg orally) or placebo administration, 5 patients received LVP (0.06 IU/kg i.v. over 1 h) and 6 patients received oCRH (1 micrograms/kg i.v. as bolus). In all patients loperamide induced a significant fall in plasma ACTH levels. LVP increased ACTH levels after both loperamide (from 48 +/- 17.3 to a peak of 95 +/- 21 pmol/l) and placebo (from 231 +/- 59.5 to 365 +/- 86.6 pmol/l): the interaction between treatments and time was not significant.

These data demonstrate that loperamide differently modifies the stimulatory action of LVP and CRH on ACTH secretion: namely, LVP and loperamide act in an additive manner, while CRH and loperamide interact in a non additive way.

The effect of the four mono- and bisquaternary ammonium compounds tetramethylammonium (TMA), hexamethonium, decamethonium and suxamethonium on the reactivatability of soman-inhibited, solubilized AChE from human erythrocytes was investigated in vitro. All compounds were reversible inhibitors of AChE; the respective dissociation constants and the type of inhibition exhibited considerable differences. The affinities to both the active and the allosteric site were considerably higher for suxamethonium (Kii 81.3 microM; Ki 15.9 microM) and decamethonium (Kii 15.4 microM; Ki 4.4 microM) than for TMA (Kii 1 mM; Ki 289.6 microM) and hexamethonium (Kii 4.5 mM; Ki 331.8 microM).

One hour after the completion of EIS, the value of FPA was significantly increased to 38.1 +/- 11.1 ng/ml (mean +/- s.e.m.) from a pre-EIS value of 7.1 +/- 1.4 ng/ml (P less than 0.01) and it gradually returned to normal range by 48 h after EIS. A very similar change was observed in the value of B beta 15-42 (P less than 0.01). These observations indicated that EIS provokes transient activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis. In vitro studies, however, revealed that EO inhibits fibrin clot formation because of the Ca2+-chelating ability of its constituent ethanolamine, although oleate or benzyl alcohol exhibited procoagulant activity in FPA formation in vitro. Nevertheless, an external application of EO or oleate over decapsulized kidney of rat resulted in a significant accumulation of 125I-labelled fibrin(ogen). From these results it was suggested that intravascular injection of EO, which exerts an inhibitory effect on coagulation in vitro, activates the local coagulation system. The activation may be accelerated by an acute inflammatory process provoked by oleate, which is supported by such clinical manifestations as mild fever, retrosternal pain leukocytosis and an increase in plasma fibrinogen level which was observed in all during the period.",

Astemizole, 10 mg, was significantly better than placebo in alleviating both nose (P less than 0.05) and eye (P less than 0.01) symptoms despite significantly greater use of the reserve medication, clemastine, by the placebo group (P less than 0.003). There was a lag period of 5 days after initiation of therapy before treatment benefit became manifest. Subdivision of nasal symptoms indicated significant improvement compared to placebo over the 8 weeks for sneezing (P less than 0.05) and runny nose (P less than 0.05) but not blocked nose. The absence of effect on nasal blockage was confirmed by parallel measurement of nasal calibre by body plethysmography. The antihistaminic potency of astemizole was indicated by an 80% inhibition of the histamine induced skin weal response after 8 weeks therapy. A positive correlation was found between serum drug levels and % inhibition of histamine skin weal (r = 0.64, P less than 0.001).

With molybdate present to stabilize receptors, the affinities of the two sites for [3H]aldosterone in adrenalectomized perfused rat brain cytosols were 0.28 and 18.0 nM at 4 C. High affinity sites comprised 15% of the total receptor number. A small contamination of perfused brain cytosol preparations with corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) was found. However, due to the very high affinity of CBG for corticosterone at 4 C, this slight contamination resulted in significant alterations in the apparent affinity of steroids competing for aldosterone-binding sites. Selective precipitation of cytosol receptors with 36% (NH4)2SO4 reduced CBG concentrations to negligible levels. After blockade of low affinity sites with a highly selective glucocorticoid (RU 26988), the order of steroids in competing for the high affinity receptor was desoxycorticosterone greater than fludrocortisone greater than corticosterone greater than aldosterone greater than progesterone greater than dexamethasone. Readdition of a small quantity of dialyzed serum to cytosol preparations yielded a profile of steroid binding similar to that of the kidney mineralocorticoid receptor (aldosterone greater than desoxycorticosterone greater than corticosterone). The distribution of both receptors in brain regions of adrenalectomized rats was determined. Both receptors were at greatest density in the hippocampus and lowest density in the hypothalamus. The high affinity site was at greatest density in limbic regions, whereas the low affinity receptor, apparently identical to the glucocorticoid type II receptor, was at greatest density in cortex and cerebellum. It is concluded that the high affinity aldosterone receptor of rat brain, which had been identified in preliminary studies as a mineralocorticoid receptor, may bind either corticosterone or aldosterone in vivo.",

When administered to immature castrated rats up to the daily dose of 100 mg/kg, it is devoid of any androgenic activity but efficiently blocks the growth-promoting activity of androgens on ventral prostate and seminal vesicle weight, thus showing the characteristics of a pure antiandrogen. In intact animals, on the other hand, the antiandrogen administered alone exerts only a partial inhibition of prostate and seminal vesicle weight. This is due to the property of the pure antiandrogen to neutralize the inhibitory feedback effect of androgens at the pituitary level on the LH responsiveness to LHRH, as illustrated in vitro in rat anterior pituitary cells in culture as well as in vivo in intact and castrated animals. In intact animals, neutralization of the inhibitory feedback action of endogenous androgens leads to an increased LH and testosterone secretion, which partly overcomes the direct action of the antiandrogen at the level of the prostate and seminal vesicles. In fact, the plasma testosterone concentration is more than doubled 6 hr after the administration of 10 mg of RU 23908 while plasma LH and testosterone levels are increased by 7- and 17-fold, respectively, after 14 days of similar daily treatment. Efficient neutralization of the androgenic action at the prostatic level in intact animals thus requires prevention of this escape phenomenon through inhibition of LH secretion. Although inhibition of LH release can be achieved by estrogen and progestins, an optimal inhibitory effect on the prostate is obtained by the combined administration of the antiandrogen with an LHRH agonist that causes a specific blockage of testicular androgen biosynthesis as well as an inhibition of the LH responsiveness to LHRH.",

A protein of molecular weight (Mr) approximately 20,000 has been isolated from supraoptic nuclei of rat hypothalami which, after tryptic cleavage, released a neurophysin-like molecule of Mr approximately 10,000 and an oligopeptide related to oxytocin.

        "input": "The aim of the study was to determine whether the dihydroxylated antiestrogen LY117018, with a high affinity for the estrogen receptor and low intrinsic estrogenic activity, could inhibit the uterotropic actions of steroidal [estradiol-17 beta (E2)] and nonsteroidal [ICI 3188 and trianisylchloroethylene (TACE)] estrogens in immature rats and also the uterotropic actions of tamoxifen and monohydroxytamoxifen in the ovariectomized mouse and immature rat. In the first series of experiments, LY117018 was compared with monohydroxytamoxifen. Both antiestrogens inhibited the uterotropic actions of E2 (0.32 micrograms daily), ICI 3188 (5 micrograms daily), and TACE (40 and 160 micrograms daily) in a dose-related manner (0.32-82 micrograms daily). The potency of the antiestrogens against E2 and ICI 3188 was similar, however, at higher doses (20.48 and 82 micrograms daily) LY117018 reduced uterine weights to below the lowest level achieved by monohydroxytamoxifen. In contrast, LY117018 was less effective against the long acting estrogen TACE. The competitive interaction of LY117018 with tamoxifen and monohydroxytamoxifen was compared in 3-day ovariectomized mouse and immature rat uterine weight tests. Tamoxifen and monohydroxytamoxifen were fully estrogenic in the mouse (5 micrograms daily) and partially estrogenic in the rat (1.5-20 micrograms daily). LY117018 was a partial estrogen in the mouse and a weekly active partial estrogen in the rat (2.5-120 micrograms daily). LY117018 produced dose-related decreases in the uterine weight increases induced by tamoxifen and monohydroxytamoxifen in both species. However, in the rat, LY117018 was more effective against the less potent compound tamoxifen, at a 6:1 dosage ratio compared with a 24:1 dosage ratio required for the potent compound monohydroxytamoxifen. LY117018 had a short duration of action as an antiestrogen when compared with monohydroxytamoxifen. LY117018 (120 micrograms) was only completely effective as an antiestrogen if administered repeatedly with E2 whereas a single injection of monohydroxytamoxifen (120 micrograms) was sufficient to inhibit fully E2 action in the uterus for up to 4 days. Because LY117018 has a shorter duration of action than monohydroxytamoxifen, a high dosage ratio of LY117018 over monohydroxytamoxifen is required to maintain effective competitive antagonism in the uterus. Overall, these findings suggest that monohydroxytamoxifen and LY117018 probably act through the same mechanism of action via the estrogen receptor.",

Functional affinity estimates for these compounds were also determined from noradrenaline-mediated contractions of rat aorta. 2. BMY 7378 displayed high affinity for cloned human alpha 1D-adrenoceptors (pKi = 8.2 +/- 0.10) and was selective over alpha 1A (pKi = 6.2 +/- 0.10) and alpha 1B subtypes (6.7 +/- 0.11). WB 4101, benoxathian and phentolamine displayed high affinity for alpha 1A and alpha 1D adrenoceptors compared to the alpha 1B subtype. Spiperone displayed high affinity and selectivity for alpha 1B adrenoceptors (pKi 8.8 +/- 0.16). 5-Methyl-urapidil was selective for cloned alpha 1A adrenoceptors. 3. Comparative binding affinities (pKi) for compounds at cloned human and rat1D adrenoceptors were almost identical (r = 0.99, slope = 1.08). 4.

The selective alpha 1D antagonist BMY 7378 was also a potent antagonist on rat aorta (pKB = 8.3 +/- 0.1) but the interaction of this compound was not consistent with competitive antagonism at a single population of receptors. 5.

Noradrenaline-mediated contractions of rat aorta were sensitive to the alkylating effects of chlorethylclonidine (CEC). CEC (10 microM) caused a small rightward shift in the noradrenaline concentration-response curve. CEC at 100 microM caused a further shift and suppression of the maximum response to noradrenaline.7.

        "input": "We have used the polymerase chain reaction technique to selectively amplify a guanine nucleotide-binding protein-coupled receptor cDNA sequence from rat striatal mRNA that exhibits high homology to previously cloned serotonin receptors. Sequencing of a full length clone isolated from a rat striatal cDNA library revealed an open reading frame of 1311 base pairs, encoding a 437-residue protein with seven hydrophobic regions. Within these hydrophobic regions, this receptor was found to be 41-36% identical to the following serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] receptors: 5-HT2 > 5-HT1D > 5-HT1C > 5-HT1B > 5-HT1A > 5-HT1E. Northern blots revealed a approximately 4.2-kilobase transcript localized in various brain regions, with the following rank order of abundance: striatum >> olfactory tubercle > cerebral cortex > hippocampus. Expression of this clone in COS-7 cells resulted in the appearance of high affinity, saturable binding of (+)-[2-125I] iodolysergic acid diethylamide ([125I]LSD) with a Kd of 1.26 nM. Among endogenous biogenic amines, only 5-HT completely inhibited [125I]LSD binding (Ki = 150 nM). The inhibition of [125I]LSD binding by other serotonergic agonists and antagonists revealed a pharmacological profile that does not correlate with that of any previously described serotonin receptor subtype. In addition, this receptor exhibits high affinity for a number of tricyclic antipsychotic and antidepressant drugs, including clozapine, amoxipine, and amitriptyline. In HEK-293 cells stably transfected with this receptor, serotonin elicits a potent stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity, which is blocked by antipsychotic and antidepressant drugs. The distinct structural and pharmacological properties of this receptor site indicate that it represents a completely novel subtype of serotonin receptor. Based on its affinity for tricyclic psychotropic drugs and its localization to limbic and cortical regions of the brain, it is likely that this receptor may play a role in several neuropsychiatric disorders that involve serotonergic systems.",

In the present study, three local anesthetics previously shown to be self-administered in animals were examined in squirrel monkeys trained to discriminate cocaine (0.3 mg/kg) from saline in a two-lever, food-reinforced procedure. Dimethocaine (0.1-3.0 mg/kg) fully and dose-dependently substituted for cocaine.

Constitutive and inducible forms of human cyclo-oxygenase (hCOX-1 and hCOX-2) were cloned and expressed in insect cells, utilizing a baculovirus expression system. hCOX-1 had a specific activity of 18.8 mumol of O2/mg with a Km of 13.8 microM for arachidonate and Vmax. of 1500 nmol of O2/nmol of enzyme, whereas hCOX-2 had a specific activity of 12.2 mumol of O2/mg with a Km of 8.7 microM for arachidonate and a Vmax. of 1090 nmol of O2/nmol of enzyme. Indomethacin inhibited both hCOX-1 and hCOX-2, whereas NS-398 and Dup-697 selectively inhibited hCOX-2. Both NS-398 and Dup-697 exhibited time-dependent inactivation of hCOX-2, as did indomethacin on both enzymes. The competitive inhibitor of hCOX-1, mefenamic acid, also displayed competitive inhibition of hCOX-2. These results demonstrate the ability to generate selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which could provide useful improvement therapeutically in the treatment of chronic inflammatory disease.",

        "input": "An experimental strategy based on solution viscosity perturbation allowed us to study the energetics of amide-substrates, p-aminobenzamidine (p-ABZ) and proflavin binding to the catalytic site of two proteolyzed forms of alpha-thrombin, i.e. zeta- and gamma T-thrombin. These thrombin derivatives are cleaved at the Leu144-Gly150 loop and at the fibrinogen recognition exosite (FRS), respectively. A phenomenological analysis of thermodynamic data showed that the amide substrates and p-ABZ interactions with zeta-thrombin were respectively, associated with a chemical compensation (i.e. the linear relationship between entropy and enthalpy of binding) and a hydrophobic phenomenon (i.e. a change in the standard heat capacity). The latter was slightly lower than that previously observed for a alpha-thrombin (0.78 +/- 0.25 versus 1.01 +/- 0.17 kcal/mol K). Both phenomenon were absent in gamma T-thrombin. The interaction of a alpha-, zeta- and gamma T-thrombin with macromolecular substrates that \"bridge-bind\" to both the catalytic site (CS) and fibrinogen recognition exosite (FRS), such as fibrinogen and the cleavable platelet receptor (CPR), was also evaluated. These interactions were studied by following fibrinopeptide A (FpA) release and by measuring intraplatelet Ca2+ changes induced by thrombin-CPR interaction. It was found that the free energy of activation (RT ln Kcat/Km) for both fibrinogen and CPR hydrolysis followed the same hierarchy, i.e. alpha > zeta > gamma. Moreover, the values of delta Cp for alpha-, zeta- and gamma T-thrombin interaction with p-ABZ were found to be linearly correlated to the free energy of activation for both fibrinogen and CPR cleavage. In conclusion, these data demonstrate that: (1) the Leu144-Gly150 loop and the FRS are both involved in the conformational transition linked to the binding of p-aminobenzamidine to the thrombin active site; (2) the extent of thrombin's capacity to undergo conformational transitions in alpha-, zeta- and gamma T forms is positively correlated to the free energy of activation for hydrolysis of macromolecular substrates interacting with both the catalytic domain and the FRS.",

This specific binding of [3H]EBOB is strongly inhibited by: a large number and variety of insecticidal channel blockers at 20 nM (lindane, alpha-endosulfan, dieldrin, 12-ketoendrin, fipronil, and a representative bicycloorthobenzoate and dithiane) or 200 nM (picrotoxinin); the insecticidal channel activators avermectin and moxidectin at 20 nM; muscimol at 30 microM and GABA at 300 microM. Cyclodiene resistance in D. melanogaster has been attributed to a mutation resulting in an Ala302-->Ser replacement in the Rdl GABA receptor subunit and in D. simulans to an homologous Ala-->Ser or Gly replacement. These mutations are shown here to greatly reduce [3H]EBOB binding, i.e. lower affinity and apparent number of binding sites. The Ala-->Ser replacement with both melanogaster and simulans almost always reduces the potency in inhibiting [3H]EBOB binding of each of eight channel blockers and of muscimol and GABA. The Ala-->Gly replacement in D. simulans is generally less effective than the Ala-->Ser modification in reducing sensitivity to the channel blockers and to muscimol and GABA. The channel activators avermectin and moxidectin usually retain their inhibitory potency in the Rdl subunit mutants. Thus, it appears that replacement of Ala by Ser generally modifies the non-competitive blocker site and its coupling to the GABA-recognition site with less effect on the channel activator site. In contrast, the Ala-->Gly replacement has less impact in protecting the chloride channel from the action of insecticidal blockers. Each of the resistant strains has the same level of resistance to the lethal action of the five channel blockers examined but none to avermectins and muscimol.",

For comparison, the effects of D-1997 were also evaluated on rat aorta. Canine basilar artery and rat aortic rings were prepared and mounted in organ baths to record isometric tension changes. The contractile effects of D-1997 in the basilar artery were compared with those produced by 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and the 5-HT receptor agonist quipazine. Thus, 4-HT (10(-10)-10(-6)M), D-1997 (3.1 x 10(-8)-10(-4) M) and quipazine (3.1 x 10(-7)-10(-4) M) each caused concentration-dependent contractions of the canine basilar artery with a rank order of agonist potency of 5-HT > D-1997 > quipazine. 5-HT and D-1997 exhibited similar maximum effects which were higher than that of quipazine. Similar concentrations of D-1997 failed to produce contraction in rat aorta. The effects of D-1997 in the basilar artery were not modified by incubation with either the 5-HT2 receptor antagonist ketanserin (0.01-1 microM), the 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 receptor antagonist ICS205930 (tropisetron; 0.1-10 microM), the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist spiroxatrine (0.01-1 microM), the beta-adrenoceptor blocker with high affinity for 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B binding sites (+/-)-pindolol (0.01-1 microM), or the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (0.01-1 microM). In contrast, the D-1997-induced responses were potently and concentration-dependently antagonized by the mixed 5-HT1-like and 5-HT2 receptor antagonist methiothepin (0.01-1 microM). It is concluded that D-1997 contracts the canine basilar artery by stimulating 5-HT1-like receptors unrelated to either the 5-HT1A or 5-HT1B receptor subtypes.

The effect of sucralfate in reducing parietal cell sensitivity may be another factor important in the lower relapse rate demonstrated after duodenal ulcer healing. Sucralfate has been demonstrated to be efficacious in healing both duodenal and gastric ulcers together with mild oesophagitis, and it is safe for both short-term use and maintenance. In stress ulcer prophylaxis it is as effective as acid suppression or neutralization and has the advantage of lesser rates of nosocomial pneumonia than are demonstrated with antacids or H2 antagonists.

These nonadrenergic sites were radiolabeled even in the presence of a 10 microM norepinephrine mask of alpha-2 adrenoceptors. Heterogeneity at the nonadrenergic sites was demonstrated by comparing [3H]idazoxan (IDX) binding vs. [125I]p-iodoclonidine (PIC) binding. Nonadrenergic [125I]PIC-labeled sites were enriched in platelet plasma membranes, whereas the nonadrenergic sites labeled by [3H] IDX were codistributed between plasma and internal membranes (nonadrenergic [125I]PIC-labeled sites had Bmax = 62 fmol/mg in plasma membranes and 20 fmol/mg in internal membranes vs. the [3H]IDX-labeled sites had Bmax = 141 fmol/mg in plasma membranes and 192 fmol/mg in internal membranes). Furthermore, competition binding studies in the presence of a 10 microM norepinephrine mask revealed major (approximately 75%) and minor (approximately 25%) binding components on plasma membranes for [125I]PIC. Affinities for the major nonadrenergic [125I]PIC binding site were highly comparable to human subtype-I1 imidazol(in)e receptor sites in the brain stem (rank order: moxonidine > clonidine > cirazoline > IDX > amiloride). However, the minor component of [125I]PIC binding was similar to a site reported in kidney, having low affinities for all compounds tested, except guanabenz. Finally, a third nonadrenergic internal membrane site, labeled by [3H]IDX, was consistent with a subtype-I2 imidazol(in)e receptor site (rank order: cirazoline > IDX >> amiloride > moxonidine > clonidine). Thus, based on differential subcellular distributions and affinity constants, human platelets appear to possess imidazoline receptors (subtype-I1 imidazol(in)e receptor and subtype-I2 imidazol(in)e receptor), plus a novel guanabenz-sensitive site, as well as an alpha-2A adrenoceptor. These nonadrenoceptor binding sites may explain certain novel platelet aggregatory properties previously ascribed to clonidine and endogenous clonidine-displacing substance(s), and may serve as markers of imidazoline receptors in humans.",

        "input": "Glucocorticosteroids (GCS) are beneficial in allergic asthma. GCS therapy results in reduced mRNA expression of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-5 in cells from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) but not of IFN-gamma. In vitro studies with blood-derived T cells, however, show inhibition of all three cytokines by GCS. We studied the effects of GCS on T cells from BAL in vitro, namely Th0-, Th1, and Th2-like clones; and we compared BAL- with blood-derived clones. Dexamethasone (DEX) inhibited the anti-CD3-induced production of IL-4, IL-5 and IFN-gamma in all 20 clones tested. IFN-gamma production was inhibited significantly less than IL-4 and IL-5. DEX enhanced the ratio IFN-gamma/IL-4 (mean +/- SEM: control, 28.7 +/- 17.6; with 10-7 M DEX, 55.0 +/- 27.5, P<0.005). Interestingly, two categories of clones were distinguished based on the effects of GCS on IL-2 production and IL-2R alpha expression and proliferation; 1) In low IL-2 producers DEX blocked IL-2 production and decreased IL-2R alpha expression and proliferation; 2) In high IL-2 producers DEX inhibited IL-2 production partially and enhanced IL-2R alpha expression and proliferation. Anti-IL-2 and anti-IL2R alpha blocked the DEX-induced increase in proliferation. High levels of added IL-2 induced the second type of response. In conclusion, the production of IL-4 and IL-5 by T-cell clones (derived either from BAL or blood) was more sensitive to inhibition by DEX than that of IFN-gamma, which may account for the therapeutic effects of glucocorticosteroids in patients with asthma. The differential effects of DEX on the proliferation of high and low IL-2 producers in vitro may implicate a selective outgrowth of Th1-like T cells in vivo in patients treated with steroids.",

Receptors were transiently expressed in COS-3 cells, and their binding characteristics were studied with SR 141716A and with CP 55,940, an agonist recognized equally well by the two receptors. The region delineated by the fourth and fifth transmembrane helices of CB1 proved to be crucial for high affinity binding of SR 141716A. The CB1 and CB2 second extracellular loops, e2, were exchanged, modifications that had no effect on SR 141716A binding in the CB1 variant but that eliminated CP 55,940 binding in both mutants. The replacement of the conserved cysteine residues in e2 of CB2 by serine also eliminated CP 55,940 binding, but replacement of those in CB1 resulted in the sequestration of the mutated receptors in the cell cytoplasm.

Relying on these findings, as well as on our clinical observations, we studied in vitro and in vivo the effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on CA I and CA II. We also followed in vitro the effects on these isozymes of NSAIDs associated to histamine, Ca, PGE2 and acetazolamide. The results show that the NSAIDs used here, which reduce the activity of cyclooxygenase and PG production, activated CA I and CA II in a dose-dependent manner by a mechanism of the noncompetitive type. Histamine and Ca added to NSAIDs amplified the activating effect of the latter on CA II. Association of PGE2 or acetazolamide to NSAIDs reduced NSAID-induced activation of CA I and CA II. Indomethacin abolished the inhibitory effect of acetazolamide on CA I and CA II. Our data imply that between CA and cyclooxygenase there is an inverse relationship, CA activation being accompanied by reduction of cyclooxygenase activity, a reduction achieved by the pH modifications induced by CA activation.

The profile of a range of alpha 1 adrenoceptor antagonists was determined in vitro against cloned human alpha 1A, alpha 1B and alpha 1D adrenoceptors and against noradrenaline-mediated contractions of rat aorta and human prostate. The in vivo profile of compounds was determined in an anaesthetized dog model which allowed the simultaneous assessment of antagonist potency against phenylephrine-mediated increases in blood pressure and prostatic pressure. 2. The quinazoline antagonists, prazosin, doxazosin and alfuzosin displayed high affinity but were non selective for the three cloned human alpha 1 adrenoceptors. Indoramin and SNAP 1069 showed selectivity for alpha 1A and alpha 1B adrenoceptors relative to the alpha 1D subtype. Rec 15/2739, WB 4101, SL 89,0591, (+)- and (-)- tamsulosin showed selectivity for alpha 1A and alpha 1D adrenoceptors relative to the alpha 1B subtype. RS 17053 showed high affinity and selectivity for alpha 1A adrenoceptors (pKi 8.6) relative to alpha 1B (pKi = 7.3) and alpha 1D (pKi = 7.1) subtypes. 3. (+)-Tamsulosin, (-)-tamsulosin, SL 89,0591, Rec 15/2739, SNAP 1069 and RS 17053 appeared to act as competitive antagonists of noradrenaline-mediated contractions of rat aorta yielding pA2 affinity estimates which were similar to binding affinities at cloned human alpha 1D adrenoceptors. The following rank order was obtained: prazosin = (-)-tamsulosin > doxazosin > SL 89,0591 = (+)-tamsulosin > Rec 15/2739 > RS 17053 = SNAP 1069. 4. (-)-Tamsulosin was a very potent, insurmountable antagonist of noradrenaline-mediated contractions of human prostate, yielding an approximate pA2 estimate of 9.8 at 1 nM. The corresponding (+)-enantiomer was 30 fold weaker. SL 89,0591, SNAP 1069 and Rec 15/2739 yielded pA2 estimates which compared well with their alpha 1A binding affinities. The affinity estimate for prazosin on human prostate was lower than the corresponding binding affinity determined at alpha 1A adrenoceptors and RS 17053 was a very weak antagonist on human prostate (pA2 = 6.0) relative to the high affinity (pKi = 8.6) determined at cloned human alpha 1A adrenoceptors. 5. In the anaesthetized dog, in vivo pseudo \"pA2' values showed that doxazosin, (+)- and (-)-tamsulosin inhibited phenylephrine-induced increases in prostatic and blood pressure with similar affinity, implying that these agents show little or no selectivity for prostatic responses in this model. SL 89,0591 and SNAP 1069 were moderately selective (3 and 6 fold respectively) for prostatic pressure relative to blood pressure. Rec 15/2739 was a more potent antagonist of phenylephrine-mediated increases in prostatic pressure (\"pA2' = 8.74) compared to blood pressure (\"pA2' = 7.51). 6. Data in this study suggest that the alpha 1 adrenoceptor mediating noradrenaline-induced contractions of human prostate, whilst having some of the characteristics of an alpha 1A adrenoceptor, cannot be satisfactorily aligned with cloned alpha 1A, alpha 1B or alpha 1D adrenoceptors. In addition, studies in the anaesthetized dog have shown that agents having high affinity and selectivity for prostatic alpha 1 adrenoceptors, particularly over the alpha 1D subtype, appear to inhibit phenylephrine-induced increases in prostatic pressure selectively compared to blood pressure.",

Affinities (Ka) of alpha-2 adrenoceptor subtype-selective drugs for blocking relaxation were obtained in side-by-side experiments comparing rat mesenteric arteries with pig coronary arteries. Relaxation of pig coronary arteries is known to be mediated by the alpha-2A adrenoceptor subtype. Ka values in nM for rauwolscine (19), WB-4101 (265), SKF-104078 (197), spiroxatrine (128), and prazosin (1531) for blocking relaxation in rat arteries were consistent with their affinities for binding at the alpha-2D adrenoceptor subtype. Ka values for rauwolscine and WB-4101, drugs distinguishing the alpha-2D from the alpha-2A adrenoceptor subtype, were significantly higher in blocking relaxation of rat arteries compared with pig arteries, suggesting the alpha-2D adrenoceptor subtype mediates NO-induced relaxation in rat arteries. We used forskolin to oppose alpha-2 adrenoceptor-mediated inhibition of cAMP formation by directly stimulating cAMP formation in endothelium.

Epinastine (WAL 801CL) is an antihistaminic drug with binding affinity at certain other receptors, including alpha-adrenergic receptors and various serotonin (5-HT) receptor subtypes. It is used in asthma treatment; however, its mechanism of action remains to be fully defined. We have investigated whether epinastine could modulate the eNANC contraction in guinea-pig airways in vitro, and have tried to elucidate its receptor mechanism. Epinastine (0.1-100 microM) produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of the noncholinergic contraction, with a maximum inhibition of 91 +/- 7% at 100 microM. Pretreatment of the tissues with combined 5-HT1/5-HT2 antagonists, methysergide (1 microM) or methiothepin (0.1 microM), significantly attenuated the inhibitory effect of epinastine on the noncholinergic contraction. Pretreatment with tropisetron (1 microM), a 5-HT3 antagonist, ketanserin (10 microM), a 5-HT2 antagonist, thioperamide (10 microM), a histamine H3 antagonist, or phentolamine (10 microM), an alpha-adrenergic antagonist, however, had no effect. Chlorpheniramine (10 microM), another histamine H1 receptor antagonist without significant 5-HT receptor binding affinity, did not produce any inhibition of the eNANC contraction. Epinastine (100 microM) did not displace the dose-response curve to exogenously applied substance P (0.01-10 microM). These results suggest that epinastine, although identified as a 5-HT antagonist, acts as a 5-HT1 agonist and that it inhibits the noncholinergic contraction in guinea-pig airways through stimulation of a prejunctional 5-HT1-like receptor, located to sensory nerves.",

Phenylephrine elicited a concentration-dependent positive inotropic effect via alpha 1-adrenoceptors in the presence of either (+/-)-bupranolol or S(-)-timolol. The mode of antagonism induced by (+/-)-tamsulosin on the effect of phenylephrine was dependent or the concentration applied: (+/-)-tamsulosin at 1 and 3 nM acted in a competitive manner, the slope of the regression line of the Schild plot being unity and the pA2 value being 9.12; at 10 nM, it shifted further the concentration-response curve to the right without affecting the maximal response but the slope became less than unity. At 100 nM and higher, it suppressed the maximal response to phenylephrine. (+/-)-Tamsulosin effectively antagonized the positive inotropic effect of phenylephrine even after inactivation of alpha 1B-adrenoceptors by treatment with chlorethylclonidine, which is an indication that the (+/-)-tamsulosin-sensitive subtype belongs to a class resistant to chlorethylclonidine.

Despite a low amino acid identity between TWIK-1 and TREK-1 (approximately 28%), both channel proteins share the same overall structural arrangement consisting of two pore-forming domains and four transmembrane segments (TMS). This structural similarity does not give rise to a functional analogy. K+ currents generated by TWIK-1 are inwardly rectifying while K+ currents generated by TREK-1 are outwardly rectifying. These channels have a conductance of 14 pS. TREK-1 currents are insensitive to pharmacological agents that block TWIK-1 activity such as quinine and quinidine. Extensive inhibitions of TREK-1 activity are observed after activation of protein kinases A and C. TREK-1 currents are sensitive to extracellular K+ and Na+. TREK-1 mRNA is expressed in most tissues and is particularly abundant in the lung and in the brain. Its localization in this latter tissue has been studied by in situ hybridization. TREK-1 expression is high in the olfactory bulb, hippocampus and cerebellum. These results provide the first evidence for the existence of a K+ channel family with four TMS and two pore domains in the nervous system of mammals. They also show that different members in this structural family can have totally different functional properties.",

        "input": "This review examines the possible receptor basis of the atypical action of those atypical antipsychotic drugs that elicit low levels of Parkinsonism. Such an examination requires consistent and accurate dissociation constants for the antipsychotic drugs at the relevant dopamine and serotonin receptors. It has long been known, however, that the dissociation constant of a given antipsychotic drug at the dopamine D2 receptor varies between laboratories. Although such variation depends on several factors, it has recently been recognized that the radioligand used to measure the competition between the antipsychotic drug and the radioligand is an important variable. The present review summarizes information on this radioligand dependence. In general, a radioligand of low solubility in the membrane (i.e., low tissue:buffer partition) results in a low value for the antipsychotic dissociation constant when the drug competes with the radioligand. Hence, by first obtaining the antipsychotic dissociation constants using different radioligands of different solubility in the membrane, one can then extrapolate the data to low or \"zero\" ligand solubility. The extrapolated value represents the radioligand-independent dissociation constant of the antipsychotic. These values are here given for dopamine D2 and D4 receptors, as well as for serotonin 5-HT2A receptors. These values, moreover, agree with the dissociation constant directly obtained with the radioactive antipsychotic itself. For example, clozapine revealed a radioligand-independent value of 1.6 nM at the dopamine D4 receptor, agreeing with the value directly measured with [3H]-clozapine at D4. However, because clozapine competes with endogenous dopamine, the in vivo concentration of clozapine (to occupy dopamine D4 receptors) can be derived to be about 13 nM, agreeing with the value of 12 to 20 nM in the plasma water or spinal fluid observed in treated patients. The atypical neuroleptics remoxipride, clozapine, perlapine, seroquel, and melperone had low affinity for the dopamine D2 receptor (radioligand-independent dissociation constants of 30 to 90 nM). Such low affinity makes these latter five drugs readily displaceable by high levels of endogenous dopamine in the caudate or putamen. Most typical neuroleptics have radioligand-independent values of 0.3 to 5 nM at dopamine D2 receptors, making them more resistant to displacement by endogenous dopamine. Finally, a relation was found between the neuroleptic doses for rat catalepsy and the D2:D4 ratio of the radioligand-independent K values for these two receptors. Thus, the atypical neuroleptics appear to fall into two groups, those that have a low affinity for dopamine D2 receptors and those that are selective for dopamine D4 receptors.",

        "input": "Alcohol exerts numerous pharmacological effects through its interaction with various neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. Among the latter, the endogenous opioids play a key role in the rewarding (addictive) properties of ethanol. Three types of opioid receptors (mu, delta and kappa) represent the respective targets of the major opioid peptides (beta-endorphin, enkephalins and dynorphins, respectively). The rewarding (reinforcing) properties of mu- and delta-receptor ligands are brought by activation of the mesolimbic dopamine system which ascends from the ventral tegmentum of the midbrain (VTA) to rostral structures; of these, the nucleus accumbens (NAC) is of particular importance in drug addiction. In contrast, dysphoria results from activation of kappa-receptors. The neurochemical manifestations of these opposing effects are, respectively, increases and decreases in dopamine release in the NAC. Several lines of evidence indicate that alcohol interferes with endogenous opioid mechanisms which are closely linked with dopamine transmission in the mesolimbic pathway. The view that condensation products of dopamine and alcohol-derived aldehyde (tetrahydroisoquinolines) play a role remains controversial. There is, however, much information on the direct (acute and chronic) effects of alcohol on the binding properties of opioid receptors, as well as modulation of opioid peptide synthesis and secretion (e.g. a suggested increase in beta-endorphin release). In view of the reinforcing properties of alcohol, it is relevant to consider behavioural studies involving alcohol self-administration in rodents and primates. Low doses of morphine have been found to increase, and higher doses of the opiate to decrease, alcohol consumption. Conversely, opioid antagonists such as naloxone and naltrexone (which bind to non-selectively opioid receptors) have been shown to decrease alcohol consumption under various experimental conditions. Similar results have been reported when selective mu- or delta-receptor antagonists are administered. Results obtained in genetic models of high preference for alcohol also support the view that alcohol intake depends on the activity of the endogenous opioid reward system and that alcohol consumption may serve to compensate for inherent deficits in this system. One hypothetical model proposes that reward results from activation of mu-opioid receptors in the VTA and/or delta-receptor in the NAC; both these nuclei are targets of endogenous beta-endorphin. It is suggested that alcohol interferes with this reward pathway either directly or indirectly. The available experimental data accord well with those obtained from clinical studies which opioid antagonists have been used to prevent relapse in alcoholics. Conceptual considerations concerning communalities between various forms of addictions are also discussed in this review.",

        "input": "Binding of factor Xa to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) is contributed by effector cell protease receptor-1 (EPR-1). The structural requirements of this recognition were investigated. Factor Xa or catalytically inactive 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1sulfonyl (dansyl) Glu-Gly-Arg-(DEGR)-chloromethylketone-factor Xa bound indistinguishably to HUVEC and EPR-1 transfectants, and inhibited equally well the binding of 125I-factor Xa to these cells. Similarly, factor Xa active site inhibitors TAP or NAP5 did not reduce ligand binding to EPR-1. A factor X peptide duplicating the inter-EGF sequence Leu83-Phe84-Thr85-Arg86-Lys87-Leu88- (Gly) inhibited factor V/Va-independent prothrombin activation by HUVEC and blocked binding of 125I-factor Xa to these cells in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 approximately 20-40 microM). In contrast, none of the other factor X peptides tested or a control peptide with the inter-EGF sequence in scrambled order was effective. A recombinant chimeric molecule expressing the factor X sequence Leu83-Leu88 within a factor IX backbone inhibited binding of 125I-factor Xa to HUVEC and EPR-1 transfectants in a dose-dependent fashion, while recombinant factor IX or plasma IXa had no effect. An antibody generated against the factor X peptide 83-88, and designated JC15, inhibited 125I-factor Xa binding to HUVEC. The JC15 antibody bound to factor Xa and the recombinant IX/X83-88 chimera in a concentration dependent manner, while no specific reactivity with factors X or IXa was observed. Furthermore, binding of 125I-factor Xa to immobilized JC15 was inhibited by molar excess of unlabeled factor Xa, but not by comparable concentrations of factors X or IXa. These findings identify the inter-EGF sequence Leu83-Leu88 in factor Xa as a novel recognition site for EPR-1, and suggest its potential role as a protease activation-dependent neo-epitope. This interacting motif may help elucidate the contribution of factor Xa to cellular assembly of coagulation and vascular injury.",

FGFs signal through transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases, but heparan sulfate is also required for signaling by members of the FGF family. In addition, heparan sulfate may be involved in determining tissue distribution of FGFs. Using biotinylated FGF-2 and FGF-7 (KGF) as probes, we have identified specific interactions between FGFs and heparan sulfates in human tissues. Both FGF species bind to tissue mast cells and to epithelial cell membranes. Binding to basement membrane heparan sulfate is tissue source dependent and specific. Although FGF-2 strongly binds to basement membrane heparan sulfate in skin and most other tissue sites examined, FGF-7 fails to bind to basement membrane heparan sulfate in most locations. However, in subendothelial matrix in blood vessels and in the basement membrane of a papillary renal cell carcinoma, strong FGF-7 binding is seen. In summary, distinct and specific affinities of heparan sulfates for different FGFs were identified that may affect growth factor activation and local distribution.

A variety of pharmacological agents have been used to inhibit CaMPDE, and this inhibition occurs mostly via Ca2+-dependent association with the proteins.

The results suggest that the 63-kDa (PDE 1B1) and 60-kDa (PDE 1A2) CaMPDE isozymes are inhibited by felodipine and nicardipine by partial competitive inhibition and that these two Ca2+ antagonists appear to counteract each other. This study further demonstrates the existence of a specific site, distinct from the active site on CaMPDE, that exhibits high-affinity binding of these drugs.

        "input": "Zolmitriptan (Zomig; formerly 311C90) is a novel 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT)1B/1D receptor agonist with proven efficacy in the acute treatment of migraine with or without preceding aura. The drug differs from presently available members of this drug class in that it combines 5HT1B/1D receptor partial agonist activity with robust oral pharmacokinetics and an ability to inhibit trigeminovascular activation centrally as well as peripherally in preclinical studies. Consistent with its selectivity for 5HT1B/1D receptors, zolmitriptan produces constriction of various isolated blood vessels, most notably cranial arteries. In anaesthetized animals, these vascular effects manifest as a selective constriction of cranial arterio-venous anastomoses resulting in a redistribution of carotid arterial blood flow. This effect is produced without significant effects on heart rate, blood pressure or blood flow to the brain, heart or lungs. Zolmitriptan also inhibits trigeminal-evoked increases in cerebral blood flow in anaesthetized cats and blocks trigeminal-evoked plasma protein extravasation in the dura of guinea-pigs. These actions are consistent with a pre-junctional inhibition of neuropeptide release from perivascular afferents of the trigeminal nerve, as confirmed by independent studies showing that zolmitriptan blocks elevations of calcitonin-gene-related peptide in jugular venous blood during electrical stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion. In all of these effects, zolmitriptan is three to four times more potent than sumatriptan, but produces the same maximum response. Zolmitriptan crosses the intact blood-brain barrier to inhibit trigeminovascular activation in the brainstem. This was shown initially by the ability of the drug to block a brainstem reflex provoking vasoactive intestinal peptide release from the VIIth cranial (facial) nerve during trigeminal stimulation. Subsequent ex vivo autoradiography confirmed that intravenously injected [3H]zolmitriptan labels a discrete population of cells in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC) and nucleus tractus solitarius. Direct evidence for a central neuromodulatory effect of zolmitriptan was provided by electrophysiological experiments which clearly demonstrated that the drug inhibits the excitability of cells in the TNC after systemic administration. This novel pre-clinical profile not only distinguishes zolmitriptan from sumatriptan, but raises intriguing questions about the clinical relevance of a dual action. Studies to date show that zolmitriptan indeed modulates cranial sensory processing in humans, yet central side-effects are no different from sumatriptan. This property may account for the remarkable consistency in clinical efficacy observed in clinical trials.",

To understand the signal transduction pathway of ceramide to the nucleus, in the present study, we examined whether C2-ceramide, a cell permeable ceramide, activates c-fos serum response element (SRE). Treatment of Rat-2 fibroblast cells with C2-ceramide caused the stimulation of c-fos SRE-dependent reporter gene activity in a dose- and time-dependent manner by transient transfection analysis. Next, we examined the role of Rho family GTPases in the ceramide-induced signalling to SRE activation. By reporter gene analysis following transient transfections with various plasmids expressing a dominant negative mutant form of Cdc42, Rac1 or RhoA, C2-ceramide-induced SRE activation was shown to be selectively repressed by pEXV-RacN17 encoding a dominant negative mutant of Rac1, suggesting that Rac activity is essential for the signalling cascade of ceramide to the nucleus. In a further study to analyse the downstream mediator of Rac in the ceramide-signalling pathway, we observed that either pretreatment with mepacrine, a potent and specific inhibitor of phospholipase A2, or co-transfection with antisense cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) oligonucleotide repressed the C2-ceramide-induced SRE activation selectively, implying a critical role of cPLA2 in C2-ceramide-induced signalling to nucleus. Consistent with these results, the translocation of cPLA2 protein as well as the release of arachidonic acid, a principal product of phospholipase A2, was rapidly induced by the addition of C2-ceramide in a Rac-dependent manner.

        "input": "Factor VIII is a large complex glycoprotein that is deficient in hemophilia A. It has a domain organization consisting of A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2 where the B domain is a heavily glycosylated region that is dispensable for procoagulant activity. Factor VIII expression is 10-to 20-fold lower than the homologous coagulation factor V. Factor VIII expression is limited due to a low level of steady-state messenger RNA in the cytoplasm and inefficient transport of the primary translation product from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. Within the secretory pathway, factor VIII is processed to a heterodimer of the heavy chain (domains A1-A2-B) in a metal ion association with the light chain (domains A3-C1-C2). Upon secretion from the cell, von Willebrand factor binds the light chain of factor VIII and stabilizes the factor, preventing degradation. Protein folding within the mammalian secretory pathway is facilitated by molecular chaperones. Within the endoplasmic reticulum, factor VIII exhibits stable interaction with protein chaperones identified as the immunoglobulin-binding protein (BiP), calnexin and calreticulin. BiP is a peptide-dependent ATPase that interacts with exposed hydrophobic surfaces on unfolded proteins or unassembled protein subunits. A potential BiP binding site within factor VIII has been identified. Mutation of a single amino acid residue in the potential BiP binding site increased the secretion efficiency of factor VIII by threefold. Interestingly, the proposed BiP binding site is adjacent to a type-1 copper binding site within the A1 domain that is required for interaction between the factor VIII A1 domain and the A3 domain. We propose that Cu(I) binds the type-1 copper ion-binding site in the A1 domain and provides the essential requirement for a stable interaction between the heavy and light chains. Calnexin and calreticulin are transmembrane and lumenal proteins, respectively, localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, which associate transiently with many soluble and membrane glycoproteins during folding and subunit assembly. The calnexin and calreticulin interaction with factor VIII occurs primarily through amino-terminal linked oligosaccharides within the heavily glycosylated factor VIII B domain and this interaction appears to be required for factor VIII secretion. The findings suggest that factor VIII cycles through interactions with BiP, calnexin and calreticulin. Although the interaction with BiP does not appear to be required for factor VIII secretion, data suggest that the calnexin and/or calreticulin interaction is required for secretion. The observations suggest a unique requirement for carbohydrate processing and calnexin/calreticulin interaction that may limit the productive secretion of factor VIII and have implications for approaches towards somatic cell gene therapy for hemophilia A.",

        "input": "The risk of mortality and long-term morbidity, including loss of sexual function, associated with surgical procedures for symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) has prompted research into alternative medical therapies. Phytotherapy involves the use of herbal formulations, where the mechanisms of action are usually obscure and although studies have confirmed their effectiveness in symptom relief and improving quality of life (QOL), few placebo-controlled trials exist. Both the 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor finasteride and alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists (e.g. alfuzosin, doxazosin, prazosin, tamsulosin and terazosin) have been recommended as appropriate treatment options for patients with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) associated with benign prostatic obstruction (BPO), and their efficacy has been proven in several placebo-controlled trials. Finasteride reduces the static component of BPO--by reducing the size of the prostate--and, as a result, symptom relief is slow (6-12 months) and is predominantly restricted to patients with large prostates (> 40 g). The alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists, on the other hand, reduce the dynamic component of obstruction--relaxation of smooth muscle in the prostate, urethra and bladder neck--and provide rapid symptom relief after only a few doses, relieving LUTS more effectively than finasteride and irrespective of prostate size. All of the various alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists provide effective and comparable relief of LUTS, and an improvement in bothersomeness and symptom-related QOL. However, it is also important that the therapy is fast acting and acceptable to the patient, in that it does not interfere with other medication or produce unpleasant side effects. These documented properties of the alpha 1A-adrenoceptor antagonists make them an ideal choice for the medical treatment of symptomatic BPH.",

        "input": "The assembly and activation of oligomeric complexes of FGF, the transmembrane receptor kinase (FGFR), and heparan sulfate transmit intracellular signals regulating growth and function of cells. An understanding of the structural relationships between the three subunits and their redundancy and specificity is essential for understanding the ubiquitous FGF signaling system in health and disease. Previously, we reported that a primary heparin or heparan sulfate binding site resides in a distinct sequence in immunoglobulin (Ig)-like module II of the three modules of FGFR. Here we report that in the absence of flanking sequences, isolated Ig module II of FGFR1 supports the binding of FGF-1, FGF-2, and FGF-7 in respective order of affinity. None of the three FGFs detectably bind Ig module I or the IIIb and IIIc splice variants of Ig module III in the absence of flanking sequences. Ig module I and the C-terminus of Ig module III are dispensable for high-affinity binding of FGF-1, FGF-2, and FGF-7. Alterations in highly conserved Ig module II in the heparin binding domain and substitution of individual sequence domains spanning the entire sequence of Ig module II with those from Ig module I obliterated FGF binding. Addition of a specific number of FGFR sequences to the C-terminus of Ig module II resulted in a gain in affinity for FGF-7. Several site-specific alterations in the C-terminus of full-length FGFR1IIIc, an isoform that otherwise absolutely rejects FGF-7, resulted in gain of FGF-7 binding. These results suggest that a complex of Ig module II and heparan sulfate is the base common active core of the FGFR ectodomain and that flanking structural domains modify FGF affinity and determine specificity.",

        "input": "Local application of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, fluvoxamine and citalopram, prolonged the clearance of exogenously administered serotonin (5-HT) in both the dentate gyrus and CA3 region of the dorsal hippocampus, as measured using in vivo chronoamperometry. These effects were abolished in rats pretreated with 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine. The NE uptake inhibitors, desipramine and protriptyline, did not alter the 5-HT signal in the CA3 region, but prolonged the clearance of 5-HT in the dentate gyrus; this effect was absent in rats pretreated with 6-hydroxydopamine. From these data, it is inferred that both the SERT and NET contribute to the active clearance of exogenously applied 5-HT in the dentate gyrus. In another experiment, cyanopindolol, an antagonist of the serotonin terminal autoreceptor, also prolonged the clearance of 5-HT from the CA3 region. These and other data have generated a working hypothesis that activation of the terminal serotonin autoreceptor enhances the kinetics of 5-HT uptake through an effect on the serotonin transporter.",
