You can execute our model natively on your local device. Here we included detailed guidelines to facilitate implementation.

### Step 1
Run the following command to compile the [`alpaca.cpp`](https://github.com/antimatter15/alpaca.cpp) project:

```sh
>> git clone https://github.com/antimatter15/alpaca.cpp
>> cd alpaca.cpp

>> make chat
```

### Step 2
Download xxx.bin(model link) and place it in the same folder as the `chat` executable. The files should be organized in the following hierarchy:

```
├── alpaca.cpp                  
│   ├── chat                    
│   ├── xxx.bin                 
│   ├── ...
```

### Step 3
After downloading the model weights and putting them in the right folder, please run:

```sh
>> ./chat
```
